| - |Overload [] so that your Vector can be treated as an array.
| - |Overload << (ostream) so that if your vector were used in a cout statement it would print the entire vector without a newline.|   |        
| - |Overload + (addition) so that if your vector were used in an arithmetic operation, it would add two vectors together.|   |
| - |Overload - (substraction) so that if your vector were used in an arithmetic operation, it would subtract two vectors.|   |
| - |Overload * (multiplication) so that if your vector were used in an arithmetic operation, it would multiply two vectors.|   |
| - |Overload / (division) so that if your vector were used in an arithmetic operation, it would divide two vectors.|   |
| - |Overload == (equality) so that if your vector were used in an arithmetic operation, it would test for equality.|   |
| - |Overload = (assignment) so that you can assign another vector and take on its values.|   |
|  -|Overlad push_back to accept an array of values which will be appended to the existing vector.|   |
|         |                                                                     |                 |        |
