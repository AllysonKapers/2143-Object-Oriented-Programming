| |Overload [] so that your Vector can be treated as an array.
| |Overload << (ostream) so that if your vector were used in a cout statement it would print the entire vector without a newline.|   |        
| |Overload + (addition) so that if your vector were used in an arithmetic operation, it would add two vectors together.|   |
| |Overload - (substraction) so that if your vector were used in an arithmetic operation, it would subtract two vectors.|   |
| |Overload * (multiplication) so that if your vector were used in an arithmetic operation, it would multiply two vectors.|   |
| |Overload / (division) so that if your vector were used in an arithmetic operation, it would divide two vectors.|   |
| |Overload == (equality) so that if your vector were used in an arithmetic operation, it would test for equality.|   |
| |Overload = (assignment) so that you can assign another vector and take on its values.|   |
| |Overlad push_back to accept an array of values which will be appended to the existing vector.|   |
|         | Total:                                                              | **100**         |        |

## Testing your code

- Write a program that creates an implementation of your vector class and runs the following tests on it:
    - Create instance of `myvector` of size 10 and immediately attempt to `pop_back` (remove from empty vector should not crash).
    - Insert the values 13,31,73 into your vector. Print it out.
    - Insert 10000 items into your vector. Print the size of your vector.
    - Remove 9998 items from your vector. Print the size of your vector.
    - Print out your vector.
