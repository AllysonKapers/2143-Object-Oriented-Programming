## Homework 3 - Overloading Operators
#### Due: 02-06-2020 (Thursday @ 12:30 p.m.)

### Overview

- Using the code in [L02](../../Lectures/L02/main.cpp) overload the `<`, `>`,  `==`, and `!=` operators in the `Node` class. 
- After you are done adding that functionality, update the `Sort` method so that it compares nodes directly when determining which values get swapped. 


### Deliverables

- Add a folder to Assignments called `H03`.
- Put your edited source code in this folder. 
- Keep the `main.cpp` name for the file.
- Make sure you [COMMENT](../../Resources/01-Comments/README.md) your code!
- Bring a printed copy of your code to class on Thursday.
- Don't forget your [BANNER](../../Resources/02-Banner/README.md) (cover page).
