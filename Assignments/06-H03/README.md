## Homework 3 - Overloading Operators
#### Due: 02-06-2020 (Thursday @ 11:00 a.m.)

### Overview

- Using the code in [L02](../../Lectures/L02/main.cpp) overload the `<`, `>`,  `==`, and `!=` operators in the `Node` class. 
- After you are done adding that functionality, update the `Sort` method so that it compares nodes directly when determining which values get swapped. 


### Deliverables

- Add a folder to Assignments called `H03`.
- Put your edited source code in this folder. 
- Keep the `main.cpp` name for the file.
- Make sure you  `COMMENT` your code!
- Bring a printed copy of your code to class on Thursday.
- Don't forget your banner (cover page).
