## Framerate example
#### Due: Friday 5<sup>th</sup> beginning of Class.

Using the code from [here](https://github.com/rugbyprof/2143-Object-Oriented-Programming/blob/master/Resources/sfml_game_of_life_2.cpp).

Add:
- `int frameCount;`
- `int frameRate;`

- As data members of your `gameOfLife` class (struct).
- And use them to control how often the game board gets printed.  
- Basically only print the game board every `X`<sup>th</sup> iteration.
