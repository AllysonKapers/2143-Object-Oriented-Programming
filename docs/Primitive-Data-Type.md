Simply put, these are the data types that come, predefined, with the language. Each primitive type has a name, which is used as a keyword in respective programming languages.

Most languages do not allow the behavior or capabilities of primitive (either built-in or basic) data types to be modified by programs. Exceptions include Smalltalk, which permits all data types to be extended within a program, adding to the operations that can be performed on them or even redefining the built-in operations.[1]
