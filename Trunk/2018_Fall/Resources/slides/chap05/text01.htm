<h1>Roadmap</h1>
<p>
As we indicated at the beginning of the previous chapter, 
chapters 4 and 5 constitute a two chapter sequence.  
In chapter 4 we described the static, compile time aspects of classes
and methods.  In this chapter we will examine their dynamic features.
This includes the syntax used for message passing, how message
passing differs from procedure calls, the process of object
creation and initialization, the access to the reciever from
within a method, and memory management issues.
