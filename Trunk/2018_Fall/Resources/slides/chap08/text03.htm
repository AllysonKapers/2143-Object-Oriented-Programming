<h1>Practical Meaning of Inheritance</h1>
<p>
When we get to how this process of abstraction and categorization applies
to programming language, we find the following practical implications
of this notion.  What inheritance means is that data members defined
in a parent class become part of the child class.  And behavior defined
in the parent class are part of the child class.
<p>
Note that this interpretation is orthogonal to the visibility modifiers,
which we also discussed in an earlier chapter.  Thus a private field
in a parent is still part of the child class, but it may not be
accessible to the child class.
