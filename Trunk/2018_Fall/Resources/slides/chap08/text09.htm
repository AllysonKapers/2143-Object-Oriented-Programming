<h1>Trees vs Forests</h1>
<p>
Object-oriented languages can be divided into two categories
based on whether or not they place all objects into the same
inheritance hierarchy.  Some languages, such as Smalltalk and Java,
insist that every class have a parent class.  This naturally means
that all classes fit into one large hierarchy.
Other languages, such as C++, only use inheritance when
the programmer explicitly calls for it.  This means that the
typical object program will have many small hierarnchies, unrelated
to each other.
<p>
One advantage of the first technique is that it is possible
to declare a variable that can hold any object type.  (Namely, 
in a variable of the type defined by the
root of the inheritance hierarchy).
This is not possible in the second technique.
