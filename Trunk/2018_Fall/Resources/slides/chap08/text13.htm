<h1>Syntax for Overriding</h1>
<p>
We have been discussing the possibility of overriding very informally.
However, we should point out that many languages only permit overriding
in certain situations.  In some languages a special mark must be
placed in the parent class, while in other languages a mark is made
in the child class, and a few languages even require special keywords
in both places.
<p>
These distinctions are important from a practical point of view,
but are largely unimportant when we consider object-oriented languages
in the abstract.
