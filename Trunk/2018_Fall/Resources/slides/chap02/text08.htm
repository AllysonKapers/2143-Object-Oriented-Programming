<h1>Description of Services</h1>
<p>
Next we move to just one side of this interaction, and consider a
service provider in isolation, independently of the client who might
be utilizing the service.
At this level of abstraction the important information is the definition
of the services that are offered; the contract that indicates what
results can be expected.  Note that this description is phrased in terms
of the services that are offered, and not how those services are
realized.
