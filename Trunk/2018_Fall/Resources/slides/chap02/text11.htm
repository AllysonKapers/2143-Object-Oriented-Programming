<h1>A Method in Isolation</h1>
<p>
Finally, at the lowest level of abstraction, we can consider the
implementation of each method in isolation from the others,
and examine how it goes about providing the promised service.
<p>
What is important about this hierarchy is that every level is
important, and different information is required at every level
of detail.  A programmer must feel comfortable working at each level,
and be able to quickly move back and forth between levels,
shedding or acquiring information as needed.
