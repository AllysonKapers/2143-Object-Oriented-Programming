<h1>Illustration of OOP Concepts -- Sending Flowers to a Friend</h1>
<font size=+2>
<p>
To illustrate the concepts of OOP in an easily understood framework, consider the problem of sending flowers to a friend who lives in a different city.
Chris is sending flowers to Robin.
<p>
Chris can't deliver them directly.  So Chris uses the services of
the local Florist.
<p>
Chris tells the Florist (named Fred) the address for Robin, how much to
spend, and the type of flowers to send.
<p>
Fred contacts a florist in Robins city, who arranges the flowers,
then contacts a driver, who delivers the flowers.
<p>
If we start to think about it, there may even be other people involved
in this transaction.  There is the flower grower, perhaps somebody in
charge of arrangments, and so on.
