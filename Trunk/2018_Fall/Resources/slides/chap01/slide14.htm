<h1>Kay's Description of Object-Oriented Programming</h1>
<font size=+2>
<p>
Object-oriented programming is based on the priciple of recursive design.
<ol>
<li>Everything is an object
<p>
<li>Objects perform computation by making requests of each other through the passing of messages
<p>
<li>Every object has it's own memory, which consists of other objects.
<p>
<li>Every object is an instance of a class.  A class groups similar objects.
<p>
<li>The class is the repository for behavior associated with an object
<p>
<li>Classes are organized into singly-rooted tree structure, called an inheritance hierarchy.
</ol>
<p>
We can illustrate these principles by considering how I go about solving
a problem in real life.
