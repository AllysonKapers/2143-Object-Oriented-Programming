<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
We have reached the end of the first chapter.  Let us summarize some of
what we have learned.
<ul>
<li>
Object-oriented programming is not simply features added to
a programming language.  Rather, it is a new way of <i>thinking</i>
<li>
Object-oriented programming views a program as a community of
agents, termed <i>objects</i>.
Each object is responsible for a specific task.
<li>
An object is an encapsulation of <i>state</i> (data values) and <i>behavior</i>
(operations).
<li>
The behavior of objects is dictated by the object
<i>class</i>.
<li>
An object will exhibit its behavior by invoking a method 
in response to a message.  
<li>
A method differs from a procedure in having a receiver, and in that
the interpretation of the method differs for different receivers.
<li>
Objects and classes extend the concept of abstract data types by 
adding the notion of <i>inheritance</i>.
</ul>
