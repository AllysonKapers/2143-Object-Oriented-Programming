<h1>Agents and Communities</h1>
<p>
So the first observation is that the solution to any nontrivial 
problem requires the interaction of an entire community of
agents.  Each member of this community is a small responsibility,
a small part to play, a service that they provide to other members
of the community.  
Things work smoothly when the members of
this community interact with each other.
