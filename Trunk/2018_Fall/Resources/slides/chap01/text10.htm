<h1>Imperative Programming</h1>
<p>
So, having said that object-oriented programming is a new paradigm,
what are the different paradigms of programming.  Well, in this
course I will restrict myself to contrasting the imperative and
object-oriented models.  If you take a course in programming languages
you will encounter other models, such as functional or logic programming
paradigms.
<p>
The imperative paradigm is the traditional model of computation.
In the imperative model we think of the computer as consisting
of memory and the CPU, with the state of the computer being given by
the contents of memory.  Actions occur as a result of assignment, 
which will change the values of variables.  These actions can be
placed in loops if we want to do a lot of work.  The processing
unit is separate from memory, and acts upon memory.
