<h1>Metaphor and Problem Solving</h1>
<p>
Most of us have at least a limited experience in working cooperatively,
in organizing groups of individuals.  Thus we have a great deal of 
intuition and common sense that we can bring to the table.  We know,
for example, that often the easiest way to solve a problem is to find
somebody else who will do the work for us.  I can't deliver flowers
directly to my friend in another city, but I can ask the florist to do it
for me.
<p>
Similarly we know that in an organization of individuals, if a task
is going to happen there must be somebody whos job it is to make it happen.
If nobody does it, it won't happen.
<p>
These intuitive notions and commen sense ideas can help us when we think
of a computer program as a community of interacting individuals.
In contrast, common sense was seldom useful when a program was envisioned
in the older, process-state image, since few of us solve problems in
our everyday lives using pigeon-holes.
