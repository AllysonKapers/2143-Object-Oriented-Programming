<h1>Order of Methods</h1>
<p>
For the most part, languages don't care about the order that methods
are listed in a class definition.  Here are some guidelines.
List important topics first; think always of the reader (the human
reader, that is) and try to make their job easier.  Constructors
are usually the most important topic, and hence are usually listed
first.  Put public features before private ones.  Again, this is because
it is the public features that are most important to the human reader.
Break long lists into groups.  For example, organize methods around
high level abstractions, and group them accordingly.  Within a group
list items in alphabethical order.  These are guidelines, and as such
are not always applicable, but if you keep in mind the meta guideline
of making it easy to read and find something, you won't go far wrong.
