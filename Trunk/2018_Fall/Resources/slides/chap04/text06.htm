<h1>Class Definitions</h1>
<p>
We will now start to examine the syntax used to define classes in
various languages.  We will use as a running example the
class definition for a playing card abstraction.
Languages we will consider at various different times in this book
include Java, C++, C#, Delphi Pascal, Apple Pacal, Ruby, Python, Eiffel,
objective-C and Smalltalk.  Not all examples will be presented in
all languages, of course, and not all examples that are in the
book will be covered in the lecture slides.  But I will try to
point out when a particular language has a feature or concept that
is unique or interesting.
