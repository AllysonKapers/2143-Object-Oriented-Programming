<h1>Separation of Definition and Implementation</h1>
<p>
In many languages the definition of a method is separated from its
implementation.  In some cases, such as in C++, they may even be found
in different files.  When this occurs it is necessary to use
a fully qualified name to disambiguate a method, and make sure it
is attached to the correct class.  The slide shows an example
of this in C++.  In this language a pair of colons are used to
form a fully qualified name.  A fully qualified name can be thought
of as similar to a persons name, which is formed from their
given and their family name (for example, Chris Jones).
