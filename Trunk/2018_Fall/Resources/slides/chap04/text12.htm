<h1>Pascal Dialects</h1>
<p>
The programming language Pascal was once a widely used teaching language,
in pre OO days.  When object-oriented techniques became popular, there
were attempts to graft OO concepts on to the earlier language.  Two
of these dialects obtained a wide degree of popularity.  Larry Tesler
at Apple computer created the language Apple Object Pascal.  This
was once widely used on the Macintosh, but is now much less commonly
used.  A completely different langauge was defined by Borland.  Originally
called Turbo Pascal, it was later renamed Delphi, and sill later renamed
Kylix in the Linux platform.  Delphi is still widely used in the PC world.
<p>
There are of course many similarities in these languages due to their
common heritage, but also some important differences.
