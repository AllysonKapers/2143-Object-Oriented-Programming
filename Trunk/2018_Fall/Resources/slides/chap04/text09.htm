<h1>A C# Class Definition</h1>
<p>
Here is the same definition rewritten in Microsofts language C#.
C# does not allow enumerated data types inside a class definition, so we
have moved it to a point prior to the definition.  In C# the visibility
modifiers are placed on each item invidually, instead of a large section
as they are in C++.  Another small difference is that there is no
semicolon at the end of the class definition.   But other than these
minor variations there are obvious similarites between the two.
