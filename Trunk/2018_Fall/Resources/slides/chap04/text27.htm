<h1>Methods without Classes in Oberon</h1>
<p>
Oberon was created by Niklas Wirth, the same person who created Pascal.
This langauge does not classes, per se, only records.  Typically one
creates a record, as well as a type that represents a pointer to
this record.  (In later chapters we will see why pointers tend to play
such an important part in object-oriented languages).
<p>
One can then define functions using a special syntax, defining
the receiver for a message before the function name, and the remainder
of the arguments after the function name.
These can be used in a fashion that looks similar to other object
oriented languages, although the meaning is slightly different.
In reality, they are simply functions defined at the global scope, 
and not methods at all.
