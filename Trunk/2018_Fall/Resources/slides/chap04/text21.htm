<h1>Setters (or Mutators)</h1>
<p>
The flip side of an accessor is a method that is used to set a data
field.  Such a method is often termed a setter, or sometimes a mutator.
Mutators are less common than accessors, but the reasons for using
them are similar.  They provide better documentation, better control
over the way the data field is manipulated (for example, one can perform
safety checks before setting a value), and they make it easier to later 
modify the behavior of the method.
