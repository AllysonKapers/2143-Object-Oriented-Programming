<h1>Pointers</h1>
<p>
To simplify the problem still further, we can link the queens together.
Each queen will point to the next queen immediately on her left.
To control the program
as a whole we will send messages only to the rightmost queen, queen 8
in this picture.  Each queen will in turn only send messages to her
neighbor.
