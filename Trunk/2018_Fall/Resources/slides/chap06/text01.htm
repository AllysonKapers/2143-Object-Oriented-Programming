<h1>Statement of the Problem</h1>
<p>
The problem we will examine in this chapter is a traditional puzzle,
one that you may have encountered before or even written a program
to solve.  The problem is how to place eight queens on a chessboard
in such a way that no queen can attack any other queen.
<p>
You will recall that a queen can move any number of spaces either 
horizontally, vertically, or along diagonals.
