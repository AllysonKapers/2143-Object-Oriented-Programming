<h1> An Example, the IIKH</h1>
<p>
Imagine you are the chief software architect in a major computing firm.
One day, the president of the firm rushes into your office with a
specification for the product that will save your company from the brink
of bankrupcy. He holds what appears to be a dinner napkin on which he
has drawn various pictures, and breathlessly explains his great idea.
<p>
``Right now'', he tells you, ``every kitchen in America has a box of
index cards, on which are written favorite recipies.  Soon, every kitchen
will have a PC.  Our job, your job, will be to replace that box of
index cards with a software application.''
<p>
Stunned, you sit for a moment and stare at his dinner napkin, and wonder
how to proceed.
