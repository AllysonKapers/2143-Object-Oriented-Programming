<h1>Roadmap</h1>
<p>
In this chapter we examine abstraction.
Abstraction is the most important tool, some would claim the only tool,
that programmers use to control complexity.
Abstraction finds applicatin in a number of different mechanisms, and
we will examine these and illustrate their similarities and their
differences.  Finally, the chapter will end with a short history
of the development of abstraction tools, illustrating how object-oriented
programming fits naturally into this progression.
