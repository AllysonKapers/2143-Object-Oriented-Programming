<h1>Classes Frame and JFrame</h1>
<font size=+2>
The place to begin is the class Frame (in AWT) or JFrame (in Swing).
These give the overall window for the application, and hold features
such as the title bar and menu bar.
<ul>
<li>Many foundation methods that provide a huge amount of standard
behavior.
<p><li>A few methods that are sometimes overriden, such as <b>paint</b>.
</ul>
This is a straightforward implementation of the framework ideas
discussed in the previous chapter.

The Swing library was introduced in Java 1.3, and has slowly replaced
the older AWT library.
