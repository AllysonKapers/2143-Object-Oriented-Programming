<h1> Why Start with design ? </h1>
<p>
If the purpose of this course is to teach object oriented <i>programming</i>,
why start our discussion with a chapter on design?
<p>
The answer is that object-oriented programming involves object-oriented
<i>thinking</i>, and object-oriented <i>thinking</i> begins with
with object-oriented <i>design</i>.
<p>
Furthermore, many object-oriented techniques are difficult to motivate
with small toy programs, but take on critical importance when you
move on to consider larger software development efforts.
By focusing on design we can discuss much larger software systems than
we could consider at this point if we limited ourself simply to code.
<p>
It is difficult to explain the importance of some object-oriented
techniques without an understanding of the problems they are designed
to solve.  Concentrating on design helps us understand some of the problems
involved in programming in the large, without actually <i>doing</i>
programming in the large.
