<h1> Public and Private View</h1>
<p>
In C++ and Java, Parnas's principles find direct correspondance in
a pair of ideas called the public and private views of a class.
<br>
The public view consists of those features, both data and behavior, 
that other components can see and use.
<br>
The private view consists of those features, data and behavior,
that are used only within the conpoment, and cannot be seen by others
outside.
<p>
Eventually, when we introduce inheritance, we will see that there are
really three views of a component, since a subclass has
neither the public nor the private view of its parent.
