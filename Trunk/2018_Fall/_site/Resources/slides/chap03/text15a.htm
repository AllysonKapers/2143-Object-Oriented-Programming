<h1>The  Who/What Cycle </h1>
<p>
As we walk through the various scenarios, we go through a series of 
cycles that identify a what, followed by a who.
A <b>what</b> is the description of an action that must be performed.
A <b>who</b> is the identification of the agent that will be charged
with performing the action.
<p>
You know, from your real life experience in organizing committees or
clubs, that all actions must be assigned to an individual.  If nobody
takes charge of an action, it simply will not occur.
<p>
Sometimes, however, the appropriate agent may not at first be obvious.
For example, who should be responsible for the task of editing
an individual recipe.  Should this be something the recipe database
performs, or should it be the responsibility of another component
that represents just one recipe?
<p>
Answers to questions such as these can best be explored by trying
both alternatives, walking through scenarios with each, and seeing
which works out best.
