<h1> Software Components</h1>
<p>
As we walk through our imagined system, we will assign behavior to 
different agents.  To begin with these agents will be very abstract,
so we use a general name.  
A software <EM>component</EM> is simply an abstract design entity with which we
can associate responsibilities for different tasks.
<p>
Eventually, a component may turn out to be mapped into a class,
or a function, a module, or something entirely different.
Regardless of its final implementation form, a component should have
certain properties.
<UL>
<LI>
Each component must have a small well defined set of responsibilities
<p>
<LI>
A component should interact with other components to the minimal extent possible
