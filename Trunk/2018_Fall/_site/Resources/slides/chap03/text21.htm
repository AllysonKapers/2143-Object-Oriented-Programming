<h1> The Six Components</h1>
<p>
Having walked through the various scenarios, your design team eventually
decides that everything that needs to be done can be accomplished using
only six software components.  These are the Greeter, the Plan Manager,
the Recipe Database, the Date, a Meal, and a Recipe Object.
<p>
At this point the responsibilities of each of the components is at least
informally developed.  From this point forward you can assign the
different components to individual members of your programming team
for development.
