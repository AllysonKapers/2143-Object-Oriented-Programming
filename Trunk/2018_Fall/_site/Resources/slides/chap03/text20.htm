<h1> The Meal Component</h1>
<p>
The <b>Meal</b> component performs actions associated with a single
meal.  It allows the user to interact with the recipe database to 
select one or more recipes for the meal, it permits the number of
people to be set, thereby automatically scaling the individual 
recipes, and it can create a grocery list that includes all the 
items necessary for the indivually scaled recipes.
<p>
We do not show it here, but in practice we would continue to 
walk through the various scenarios, and ensure that every desired action
is being performed by some component, and that all behavior is 
adequantely described.
