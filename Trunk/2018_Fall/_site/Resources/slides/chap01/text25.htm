<h1>Elements of OOP - Classes</h1>
<p>
Let us return now to the story of Fred the florist.  There is certain behavior
I expect to see when I step into Fred's florist shop.  I know this because
I have had similar experience with other florists, and I know what florist
shops are like.
<p>
Thus, we say that Fred is an <i>instance</i> of the general category, or
<i>class</i> of Florists.  We will follow a convention of capitalizing class
names, although for the most part this is only a convention and is not
enforced by programming langauges.  The behavior I expect from Fred is not
particular to Fred himself, but is instead associated with the category
of all florists.  All instances of the same class will respond to the same
set of messages, and exhibit the same behavior.
