<h1>Elements of OOP - Receivers</h1>
<p>
A message can be constrasted with a function call in a conventional programming
language.
Both mechanisms are a means for abstracting, encapsulating, and naming
a desired behavior.  However, messages and function calls differ in
two very important respects.  A function exists on its own.  It may take
values as arguments, but the function can be thought of as an independent
entity.  A message, on the other hand, is always given <i>to</i> a receiver.
Thus, there is an object that is accepting responsibility for the message.
<p>
Furthermore, and more importantly, the interpretation of the message
may be different, depending upon the receiver.  The same message given to
two different receivers may elicit two different types of responses.
