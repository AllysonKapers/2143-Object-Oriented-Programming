<h1>Illustration of OOP Concepts</h1>
<p>
We can illustrate the object-oriented world view by contrasting it with
the technique I might use to solve a problem in real life.
Suppose a person named Chris wishes to send flowers to a friend name Robin 
who lives in a city many miles
away.  Chris cannot personally deliver the flowers, so Chris makes use of the
services provided by a local florist.  
<p>
Chris tells the florist (let us call him Fred), the address for Robin, how much
to spend, the type of flowers to send, and so on.
<p>
Fred in turn contacts a florist in Robin's city, who arranges the flowers,
contacts a driver, who finally delivers the flowers.
<p>
There may even be many more people involved in this tractions.  Perhaps
the person who takes the order in my friends city is not the same as the
person who makes the flower arrangment.  And the florist does not
grow the flowers herself, but must contact the flower wholesaler to
obtain her ware.
<p>
And so we see, that to solve this problem requires the interaction of
an entire community of individuals.
