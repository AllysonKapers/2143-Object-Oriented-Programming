<h1>Visualization of Imperative Programming</h1>
<p>
This is sometimes called the pigeon-hole model of computation.
This is because we think of memory as a series of boxes, perhaps with labels,
perhaps just with numeric addresses.  The computer moves from instruction to
instruction, pulling values out of boxes, acting on them, and pushing them
back into boxes.  When are are all finished, the contents of a specific
set of boxes will yield the results we seek.
<p>
This model is a rather accurate picture of the actual workings of the
computer.  However, it is not particularly useful.  Very few of us solve
our problems in real life using pigeon-holes.  So we can not use our experience
from real life to help us solve problems expressed in this fashion.
