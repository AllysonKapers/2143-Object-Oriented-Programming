<h1>Why Not build a Program out of Computers</h1>
<p>
When Alan Kay was a graduate student, he thought about the way we
conventionally think of computers, and decided it was very strange.
Why break a system down into parts that indivdually were so weak and
useless.
<p>
In mathematics there was an idea that was just becoming popular at this
time named fracticals.  The key idea of fractals is that a system will
look the same at any level of resolution.   Think of brocolli -- a
clump of brocolli looks like an individual piece, which looks like the fingers
that build up the individual piece, an so on.
<p>
So kay thought; why can't we structure a computer by building it out
of little computers.
