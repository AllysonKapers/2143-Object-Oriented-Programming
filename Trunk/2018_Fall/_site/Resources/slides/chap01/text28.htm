<h1>Elements of OOP - Inheritance</h1>
<p>
Thus, our sixth principle of object-oriented programming is that
classes can be organized into singly-rooted tree structure, called
an inheritance hierarchy.  The benefit of doing this is that
information, both data and behavior, that I associate with one
level of abstraction in this class hierarchy is automatically applicable 
to lower levels of the hierarchy.
<p>
This will turn out to be both a great organizational aid, as well as
a great tool for reducing the amount of code that must be written for
new applications.
