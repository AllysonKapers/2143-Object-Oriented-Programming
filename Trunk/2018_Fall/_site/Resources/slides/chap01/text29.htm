<h1>Elements of OOP - Overriding</h1>
<p>
I have purposely included the category Platypus in my class hierarchy,
as well as on the cover of my book, to make a specific point.
A platypus is a curious animal - it is considered to be a Mammal but
it nevertheless reproduces by laying eggs, instead of giving birth to
live young.  Thus, while we have the ``fact'' that all mammals give
birth to live young, the class Platypus overrides this behavior
and substites something new.
<p>
The important idea is that subclasses can, in certain circumstances,
overrides the behavior that they inherit from their parent classes.
<p>
Now, the exact semantics of this overriding are a little more tricky
than this simple analogy would suggest.  We will, in a later chapter,
examine this in more detail.
