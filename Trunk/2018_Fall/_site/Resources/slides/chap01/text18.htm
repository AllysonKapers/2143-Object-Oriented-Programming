<h1>Elements of OOP - Messages</h1>
<p>
To begin the process of sending flowers to my friend, Chris gives Fred a message
detailing the type of transaction desired.  Fred accepts the message,
and gives Chris a receipt.
<p>
In turn, Fred gives another message to the florist in Robins city.
This florist gives yet another message to the flower arranger, and in
time another message to the delivery van driver.
<p>
In each case the service is initiated by making a request on an object
for it to perform one of the services that it provides.
