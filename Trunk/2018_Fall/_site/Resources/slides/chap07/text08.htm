<h1>Reaction to Mouse Down Events</h1>
<p>
To get the application started, we need a method that will be 
triggered by the user hitting the mouse button.  The Apple
library uses a function called <b>mouseButtonDown</b> for this
purpose.  When the mouse goes down, we give the cue ball some energy.
Here the cue ball is being held in a global variable.
We also set the direction of the cue ball as away from the mouse
position.  Then we loop over every ball, updating each in turn.
As long as some ball is moving, the loop continues.
<p>
The important thing to note about this program is that the
overall control is rather simple, and that the effect is achived
by putting more responsibility into the individual objects themselves.
Each ball is responsible for its own behavior, the controlling program
knows very little about what is happening to any individual ball.
