<h1>Graphical Object Class</h1>
<p>
Our game will be structured around graphical objects, representing
balls, cue ball, walls, and holes.  Each type of graphical
object will be held on a linked list of similar objects.
<p>
We will make use of routines and data types provided by Object 
Pascal whenever possible.  One such data type is the class
<b>Rect</b>, which declares a rectangular region of the playing
surface. Every graphical object will have a region of the board
in which it is displayed.
<p>
Every object knows how to initialize itself.  Since Object Pascal
does not have constructors this will be achived by means of a procedure
we will call initialize.  Every object knows how to draw itself,
and every object will determine what it is to do when it is hit by 
a ball.
