<h1>Overloaded Constructors</h1>
<p>
Constructors are one of the most common places to see function overloading.
Overloading means there is more than one function body associated with
the same name.  Overloaded constructors are differentiated by
the type signature, that is, the arguments used in the function call
or declaration.
<p>
In the example there are three constructors.  One used with no arguments,
one with one argument, and one with two arguments.  The number of arguments
used in a declaration statement would indicate the constructor invoked.
