<h1>The Receiver Variable</h1>
<p>
Once a message has been accepted by a receiver, a method will be
invoked and executed.  Inside the method, the receiver for the
message can be accessed by means of a pseudo-variable, a variable
that does not require a declaration.  This pseudo-variable goes
by different names in different languages.  It is named <b>this</b>
in Java, C++, C# and some other languages.  It is named <b>self</b>
in Smalltalk, Objective-C, Object Pascal.  It is named <b>current</b>
in Eiffel.
<p>
The receiver variable can be used to make explicit references
to data fields and methods in the current object.  In some languages
this explicit referincing is required.  In other Object-Oriented languages,
it is implicit.  That is, a reference to a data field or a method
that does not have an explicit reciver will implicitly be assumed to
refer to the current object.
