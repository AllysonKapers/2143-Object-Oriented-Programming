<h1>Delphi Pascal</h1>
<p>
In contrast, here is a class definition in Delphi Pascal.  Note that
the delphi version of the language uses the keyword class, and
specifies a parent class (TObject).  By convention the names of
classes in Delphi begin with the letter T, for Type.
Delphi has visibility modifiers, like C++ and Java.  Functions are written
using the keyword function.  We have also included a definition for
a constructor, something we will discuss more in chapter 5.
