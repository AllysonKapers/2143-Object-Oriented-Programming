<h1>Static and Final</h1>
<p>
A symbolic constant in Java is a variable that is declared both static
and final.
A static attribute on a data field means that all instances share the
same value.  That is, there is one such data field per class, no matter
how many instances of the class are created.  This modifier is found
in many languages with similar meanings.
The final modifier in Java specific.  It means that this is the last
time that the variable can be assigned, and cannot be reassigned.
It does not mean that it cannot change, which is a subtle distinction.
C++ has a modifier called const that is stronger in this sense, since
it implies not only that a value cannot be reassigned, but that it
cannot change.
