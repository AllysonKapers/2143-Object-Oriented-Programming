<h1>Methods</h1>
<p>
We turn our attention now to the syntax used to define methods within
a class.  Although the syntax for methods varies widely from language
to language, all methods will have the following features.
<ul>
<li>A name.  This is the text used to select the method.
<li>A signature.  This is a description that combines the return type
and the argument type.  In languages that permit this, multiple methods
with the same name can be distinguised by different signatures.
<li>A body.  This is the code that will be executed when the method
is selected in response to a message.
</ul>
Now let us see how these parts are expressed in different langauges.
