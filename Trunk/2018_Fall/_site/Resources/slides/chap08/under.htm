I examine this material in a more Java-centric fashion in 
Chapter 8 of my book, <b>Understanding Object-Oriented Programming
with Java</b>, published by Addison-Wesley in 1998.
The text of this chapter is available here both as
<a href="under.ps">postscript</a> and as <a href="under.pdf">pdf</a>.
(Note, these files were produced from the original Latex sources,
