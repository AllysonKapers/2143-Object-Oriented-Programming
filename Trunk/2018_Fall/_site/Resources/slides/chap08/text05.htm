<h1>Inheritance is both Extension and Contraction</h1>
<p>
Is a child class an extension or a contraction of the parent?
In fact, it is both.  Because the child class has all the behavior
of the parent, and can add more, it is an extension.  But because
the child class can override that behavior to make it fit a specialized
situation, it is a restriction or a contraction of the parent.
<p>
THis interplay between inheritance and overriding, extension and
contraction, generalization and specialization, is what allows
object-oriented systems to include very general tools and specialize then
for specific projects.  This interplay is ultimately the source
of the power for OOP.
