<h1>Roadmap</h1>
<p>
In this chapter we start to explore the concepts of inheritance
and substitution.  Inheritance is one of the hallmarks of object-oriented
programming.  But the simple idea has many subtle implications
that might not at first seem obvious.  In this chapter we will
explopre the intuitive and practical meaning of inheritance,
the syntax used to describe inheritance in various langauges,
some of the various different forms of inheritance, that is, the
way that inheritance is used, and some of the benefits as well
as some of the costs of inheritance.
