- Each question is graded based on the criteria below.
- I try to use the criteria to your advantage, I don't use it to hammer you. 
- The big picture is that I look at a question and decide if it's `A`,`B`, `C`, `D` or `F` work.
- If the criteria benefits you, I use it.
- If it doesn't, I assign a letter grade to your answer, and take points accordingly. 
    - Example: A work = logically correct, and syntactically good (maybe a forgotten semi-colon)
    - B work: logically ok (mostly works), syntax is still decent.
    - C work: logically meh, 
    - you get the picture

#### For questions 2-5:
- Minimum class syntax correct: 10%
```cpp
class name{
private:
public:
};
```
- Appropriate data members and types chosen for class.  25%
- One or more constructors included and appropriately formatted. 25%
- No implementation unless asked. 15%
