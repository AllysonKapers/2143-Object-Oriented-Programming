## Testing your code

- Write a program that creates an implementation of your vector class and runs the following tests on it:
    - Create instance of `myvector` of size 10 and immediately attempt to `pop_back` (remove from empty vector should not crash).
    - Insert the values 13,31,73 into your vector. Print it out.
    - Insert 10000 items into your vector. Print the size of your vector.
    - Remove 9998 items from your vector. Print the size of your vector.
    - Print out your vector.
