title: Definitions
---
#### [[Attributes]]:
> The data within an object. This data represents the objects "state" and is typically the subject of an objects methods (meaning the methods can be used to change the values within the attributes thereby changing the "state" of the object).

#### [[Class]]:
> A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.

#### [[Class Variable]]: 
> A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.

#### [[Constructor]]:
> It is a special type of subroutine called to create an [[object]]. It prepares the new object for use, often accepting arguments that the constructor uses to set required member variables.

#### [[Data Member]]: 
> A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.

#### [[Destructor]]:
> A method which is automatically invoked when the object is destroyed.

#### [[Encapsulation]]:
> In programming languages, encapsulation is used to refer to one of two related but distinct notions, and sometimes to the combination thereof:
- A language mechanism for restricting access to some of the object's components.
- A language construct that facilitates the bundling of data with the methods (or other functions) operating on that data.

#### [[Function Overloading]]: 
> The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments involved.

#### [[Immutable]]
> Is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created.

#### [[Information Hiding]]:
> This is a type of encapsulation can be used to hide data members and members function... Under this definition, encapsulation means that the internal representation of an object is generally hidden from view outside of the object's definition. Typically, only the object's own methods can directly inspect or manipulate its fields.

#### [[Inheritance]]: 
> The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.

#### [[Instance]]: 
> An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.

#### [[Instance Variable]]: 
> A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.

#### [[Instantiation]]: 
> The creation of an instance of a class.

#### [[Method]]: 
> A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.

#### [[Multiple Inheritance]]:
>  Is a feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which an object or class can inherit characteristics and features from more than one parent object or parent class. It is distinct from single inheritance, where an object or class may only inherit from one particular object or class.

#### [[Mutable]]:
> An object which can be modified after it is created.

#### [[Object]]: 
> A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.

#### [[Operator Overloading]]: 
> The assignment of more than one function to a particular operator.

#### [[Virtual Method]]:
>A virtual method is one that the Abstract Base Class (ABC) says must exist in child classes, but doesn't necessarily actually implement.
