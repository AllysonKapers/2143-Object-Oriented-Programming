## Object Oriented Programming

- Is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. 
- A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of "this" or "self"). 
- In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. 
- OOP is also one way to implement _**abstract datatypes**_: the concepts of creating a datatype that behaves in a specific manner (Stack and Queue for example) in terms of the datatypes functionality  without describing its implementation <sup>[[1]]</sup>.
