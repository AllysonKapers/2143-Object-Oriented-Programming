- Encapsulation
  - Write a class definition that represents ... showing encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Overloading
  - [basic_overloading.cpp](https://github.com/rugbyprof/2143-Object-Oriented-Programming/blob/master/Resources/Test-1-StudyGuide/basic_overloading.cpp)
- Attributes / Properties
- Class Variable
- Instance Variable
  - Class variables versus instance variables
     - Class variables are declared in the class definition using the static keyword prefix.
     - While each instance of a class has its own copy of instance variables, all instances of a class share the same single copy of class variables.
  - Class methods versus instance methods
     - Class methods are declared in the class definition using the static keyword prefix.
     - Class methods are not associated with any specific instance. As a result, note that the built-in identifier this is not declared in class methods, and instance variables cannot be accessed inside a class method unless the access is qualified using a specific instance of the class.
