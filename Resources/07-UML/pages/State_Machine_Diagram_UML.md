## <span id="1"></span>What is a State Machine Diagram?

State machine diagrams are also called as state chart diagrams. State
machine diagrams are used to capture the behavior of a software system.
UML State machine diagrams can be used to model the behavior of a class,
a subsystem, a package, or even an entire system. It is also called a
Statechart or State Transition diagram.

Statechart diagrams provide us an efficient way to model the
interactions or communication that occur within the external entities
and a system. These diagrams are used to model the event-based system. A
state of an object is controlled with the help of an event.

Statechart diagrams are used to describe various states of an entity
within the application system.

There are a total of two types of state machine diagrams:

1.  Behavioral state machine

<!-- end list -->

  - It captures the behavior of an entity present in the system.
  - It is used to represent the specific implementation of an element.
  - The behavior of a system can be modelled using behavioral state
    machine diagrams.

<!-- end list -->

2.  Protocol state machine

<!-- end list -->

  - These diagrams are used to capture the behavior of a protocol.
  - It represents how the state of protocol changes concerning the
    event. It also represents corresponding changes in the system.
  - They do not represent the specific implementation of an element.

## <span id="2"></span>Why State Machine Diagram?

Statechart diagram is used to capture the dynamic aspect of a system.
State machine diagrams are used to represent the behavior of an
application. An object goes through various states during its lifespan.
The lifespan of an object remains until the program is terminated. The
object goes from multiple states depending upon the event that occurs
within the object. Each state represents some unique information about
the object.

Statechart diagrams are used to design interactive systems that respond
to either internal or external event. Statechart diagram visualizes the
flow of execution from one state to another state of an object.

It represents the state of an object from the creation of an object
until the object is destroyed or terminated.

The primary purpose of a statechart diagram is to model interactive
systems and define each and every state of an object. Statechart
diagrams are designed to capture the dynamic behavior of an application
system. These diagrams are used to represent various states of a system
and entities within the system.

## <span id="3"></span>Notation and Symbol for State Machine

Following are the various notations that are used throughout the state
chart diagram. All these notations, when combined, make up a single
diagram.

![UML state diagram
notations](./images/2c8102c3c202ffda9ed34dcfe022dc2bad195f95.png)

### Initial state

The initial state symbol is used to indicate the beginning of a state
machine diagram. ****

### Final state

This symbol is used to indicate the end of a state machine diagram. ****

### Decision box

It contains a condition. Depending upon the result of an evaluated guard
condition, a new path is taken for program execution.

### Transition

A transition is a change in one state into another state which is
occurred because of some event. A transition causes a change in the
state of an object.

### State box

It is a specific moment in the lifespan of an object. It is defined
using some condition or a statement within the classifier body. It is
used to represent any static as well as dynamic situations.

It is denoted using a rectangle with round corners. The name of a state
is written inside the rounded rectangle.

The name of a state can also be placed outside the rectangle. This can
be done in case of composite or submachine states. One can either place
the name of a state within the rectangle or outside the rectangle in a
tabular box. One cannot perform both at the same time.

A state can be either active or inactive. When a state is in the working
mode, it is active, as soon as it stops executing and transits into
another state, the previous state becomes inactive, and the current
state becomes active.

## <span id="4"></span>Types of State

Unified Modeling Language defines three types of states:

  - Simple state
      - They do not have any substrate.
  - Composite state
      - These types of states can have one or more than one substrate.
      - A composite state with two or more substates is called an
        orthogonal state.
  - Submachine state
      - These states are semantically equal to the composite states.
      - Unlike the composite state, we can reuse the submachine states.

## <span id="5"></span>How to draw a Statechart diagram?

Statechart diagrams are used to describe the various state that an
object passes through. A transition between one state into another state
occurs because of some triggered event. To draw a state diagram, one
must identify all the possible states of any particular entity.

The purpose of these UML diagrams is to represent states of a system.
States plays a vital role in state transition diagrams. All the
essential object, states, and the events that cause changes within the
states must be analyzed first before implementing the diagram.

Following rules must be considered while drawing a state chart diagram:

1.  The name of a state transition must be unique.
2.  The name of a state must be easily understandable and describe the
    behavior of a state.
3.  If there are multiple objects, then only essential objects should be
    implemented.
4.  Proper names for each transition and an event must be given.

## <span id="6"></span>When to use State Diagrams?

State diagrams are used to implement real-life working models and
object-oriented systems in depth. These diagrams are used to compare the
dynamic and static nature of a system by capturing the dynamic behavior
of a system.

Statechart diagrams are used to capture the changes in various entities
of the system from start to end. They are used to analyze how an event
can trigger change within multiple states of a system.

State char diagrams are used,

1.  To model objects of a system.
2.  To model and implement interactive systems.
3.  To display events that trigger changes within the states.

## <span id="7"></span>Example of State Machine

Following state chart diagram represents the user authentication
process.

![UML state
diagram](./images/d0f0c68459a3379b1904fd3b9331425e2ce74885.png)

There are a total of two states, and the first state indicates that the
OTP has to be entered first. After that, OTP is checked in the decision
box, if it is correct, then only state transition will occur, and the
user will be validated. If OTP is incorrect, then the transition will
not take place, and it will again go back to the beginning state until
the user enters the correct OTP.

| **The state machine has a WAIT concept, i.e., wait for an action or an event.** | The Flowchart does not deal with waiting for a concept. |
| **State machines are used for a live running system.**                          | Flowchart visualizes branching sequences of a system.   |
| **The state machine is a modeling diagram.**                                    | A flowchart is a sequence flow or a DFD diagram.        |
| **The state machine can explore various states of a system.**                   | Flowchart deal with paths and control flow.             |
