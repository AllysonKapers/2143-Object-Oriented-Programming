## What is the Use Case Diagram?

**Use Case Diagram** captures the system's functionality and
requirements by using actors and use cases. Use Cases model the
services, tasks, function that a system needs to perform. Use cases
represent high-level functionalities and how a user will handle the
system. Use-cases are the core concepts of Unified Modelling language
modeling.

## <span id="2"></span>Why Use-Case diagram?

A Use Case consists of use cases, persons, or various things that are
invoking the features called as actors and the elements that are
responsible for implementing the use cases. Use case diagrams capture
the dynamic behaviour of a live system. It models how an external entity
interacts with the system to make it work. Use case diagrams are
responsible for visualizing the external things that interact with the
part of the system.

## <span id="3"></span>Use-case diagram notations

Following are the common notations used in a use case diagram:

**Use-case:**

Use cases are used to represent high-level functionalities and how the
user will handle the system. A use case represents a distinct
functionality of a system, a component, a package, or a class. It is
denoted by an oval shape with the name of a use case written inside the
oval shape. The notation of a use case in UML is given below:

![UML UseCase
Notation](./images/e16b16f2404fd121f429d6581183713301f1260c.png)

**Actor:**

It is used inside use case diagrams. The actor is an entity that
interacts with the system. A user is the best example of an actor. An
actor is an entity that initiates the use case from outside the scope of
a use case. It can be any element that can trigger an interaction with
the use case. One actor can be associated with multiple use cases in the
system. The actor notation in UML is given below.

## <span id="4"></span>How to draw a use-case diagram?

To draw a use case diagram in UML first one need to analyse the entire
system carefully. You have to find out every single function that is
provided by the system. After all the functionalities of a system are
found out, then these functionalities are converted into various use
cases which will be used in the use case diagram.

A use case is nothing but a core functionality of any working system.
After organizing the use cases, we have to enlist the various actors or
things that are going to interact with the system. These actors are
responsible for invoking the functionality of a system. Actors can be a
person or a thing. It can also be a private entity of a system. These
actors must be relevant to the functionality or a system they are
interacting with.

After the actors and use cases are enlisted, then you have to explore
the relationship of a particular actor with the use case or a system.
One must identify the total number of ways an actor could interact with
the system. A single actor can interact with multiple use cases at the
same time, or it can interact with numerous use cases simultaneously.

</div>

Following rules must be followed while drawing use-case for any system:

1.  The name of an actor or a use case must be meaningful and relevant
    to the system.
2.  Interaction of an actor with the use case must be defined clearly
    and in an understandable way.
3.  Annotations must be used wherever they are required.
4.  If a use case or an actor has multiple relationships, then only
    significant interactions must be displayed.

## <span id="5"></span>Tips for drawing a use-case diagram

1.  A use case diagram should be as simple as possible.
2.  A use case diagram should be complete.
3.  A use case diagram should represent all interactions with the use
    case.
4.  If there are too many use cases or actors, then only the essential
    use cases should be represented.
5.  A use case diagram should describe at least a single module of a
    system.
6.  If the use case diagram is large, then it should be generalized.

## <span id="6"></span>An example of a use-case diagram

Following use case diagram represents the working of the student
management system:

![UML UseCase
Diagram](./images/6d77553898e9a88479f163b43dbcd410b2ecf899.png)

In the above use case diagram, there are two actors named student and a
teacher. There are a total of five use cases that represent the specific
functionality of a student management system. Each actor interacts with
a particular use case. A student actor can check attendance, timetable
as well as test marks on the application or a system. This actor can
perform only these interactions with the system even though other use
cases are remaining in the system.

It is not necessary that each actor should interact with all the use
cases, but it can happen.

The second actor named teacher can interact with all the functionalities
or use cases of the system. This actor can also update the attendance of
a student and marks of the student. These interactions of both student
and a teacher actor together sums up the entire student management
application.

## <span id="7"></span>When to use a use-case diagram?

A use case is a unique functionality of a system which is accomplished
by a user. A purpose of use case diagram is to capture core
functionalities of a system and visualize the interactions of various
things called as actors with the use case. This is the general use of a
use case diagram.

The use case diagrams represent the core parts of a system and the
workflow between them. In use case, implementation details are hidden
from the external use only the event flow is represented.

With the help of use case diagrams, we can find out pre and post
conditions after the interaction with the actor. These conditions can be
determined using various test cases.

In general use case diagrams are used for:

1.  Analyzing the requirements of a system
2.  High-level visual software designing
3.  Capturing the functionalities of a system
4.  Modeling the basic idea behind the system
5.  Forward and reverse engineering of a system using various test
    cases.

Use cases are intended to convey desired functionality so the exact
scope of a use case may vary according to the system and the purpose of
creating UML model.
