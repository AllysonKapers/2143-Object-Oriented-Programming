Following object-oriented concepts are required to begin with **UML**:

- **Object**: It is a real-world entity. There are multiple objects available within a single system. It is a fundamental building block of UML.
- **Class**: A class is nothing but a container where objects and their relationships are maintained.
- **Abstraction**: It is a mechanism of representing an entity without showing the implementation details. It is used to visualize the behavior of an object.
- **Inheritance**: It is a mechanism of extending an existing class to create a new class.
- **Polymorphism**: It is a mechanism of representing an object having multiple forms which are used for different purposes.
- **Encapsulation**: It is a method of binding the object and the data together as a single unit. It ensures tight coupling between the object and the data.
  
Above are also called as the basic building blocks of a UML.
