<h1>Elements of OOP - Objects</h1>
<p>
Our first principle is that everything in our universe is viewed
as an object.  There are many different objects in our imaginar scenario.
There is Chris, Robin, the florist, the florist in Robins city,
the flower arranger, the driver, the grower, and so on.
<p>
The solution to my problem comes about when everbody does whatever
job they have been assigned.  Then we have a community of agents working
smoothly together to obtain the desired result.
