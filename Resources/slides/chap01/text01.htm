<h1>Roadmap</h1>
<p>
Our intent in this course is to understand the concepts of object-oriented
programming.  In the first three chapters we will cover a variety of
introductory topics, before progressing to an examination of several
actual object-oriented programming languages.
<p>
In this first chapter we will examine, among other things, the following
topics?  What is a paradigm?  Why is the word used to described the
object-oriented mindset?  How does the programming language one works in
influence the way in which one goes about attacking a problem?
And finally, what are some of the characteristics of the object-oriented
way of thinking?
