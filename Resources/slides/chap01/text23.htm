<h1>Elements of OOP - Recursive Design</h1>
<p>
A conventional program is a universe populated by a variety of different
things; integers, real numbers, strings, arrays, functions, and so on.
In contrast, an object-oriented program is very orderly.  An object-oriented
system consists of objects.  Each object is like a minature computer.
It is a specialized processor charged with performing a specific task.
<p>
Thus, my florist Fred is an object that provides the flower ordering service.
The driver in my friends city provides the delivery service, and so on.
<p>
As part of their job, every object may require a small amount of memory,
just like a miniature computer.  The contents of this memory will, in
a pure object-oriented language, be other objects.  Thus, the entire
universe is filled with objects.
