<h1>Conflicting Objectives</h1>
<p>
Along the way, as we examine what exactly it means to use an object-oriented
approach to problem solving, I'll try to convince you of the validity of the
following two assertions:
<ul>
<li>OOP is a revolutionary idea, totally unlike anything that has come before in programming languages
<p>
<li>OOP is an evolutionary step, following naturally on the heels of earlier programming abstractions
</ul>
Although contradictory, both of these assertions have some basis in 
fact.
