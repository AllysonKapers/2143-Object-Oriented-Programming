<h1>Message Passing Syntax</h1>
<p>
Almost all object oriented languages have some syntax that distinghishes
the reciever, to make it easier to understand the message passing
expression.  A common syntax is similar to accessing a data field,
the reciever is listed, followed by a dot, followed by a message.
However some language, such as Smalltalk, will use a different syntax.
In any case, no matter what syntax is used, a message expression has
three identifyable parts, the reciever, the selector, and the list
of arguments.  (The latter is optional in some languages, if there
are no arguments).
<p>
The book describes the message passing syntax for several languages, 
we will not cover this here.
