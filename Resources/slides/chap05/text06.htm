<h1>Implicit Use of This</h1>
<p>
This slides shows this use of the receiver variable as the key to
disambiguating both data and method access.  The first code fragement
is a typical Java method.  Note the use of the message setFaceUp without
an explicit reciever, as well as the data field access faceUp.  The
bottom code fragement is equivalent, and shows how the reveiver
variable can be, and is implicitly, used to make the reference
unambiguous.
