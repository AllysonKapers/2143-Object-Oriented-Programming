In this chapter we will explore the relationships between the two concepts
of subclass and subtype.
<ul>
<li>To assert that one class is a subclass of another is to simply
say it was built using inheritance.  It is a statement concerning how
it was constructed.
<p><li>To assert that one class is a subtype of another is to say
that it preserves the purpose of the original.  It is a statement
concerning meaning.
</ul>
