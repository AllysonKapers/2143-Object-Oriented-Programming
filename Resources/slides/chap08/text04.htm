<h1>Private, Public and Protected</h1>
<p>
While we are on the topic of accessiblity modifiers, we note that
inheritance now introduces a third face to the public/private
dichotomy we discussed earlier.  There are now three possibilities.
A public feature is accessible to everybody.
A private feature is accessible only within a class.
A protected feature is accessible within a class and within child
classes.
<p>
Note that this meaning of protected is the one adopted by most languages.
Java is an exception.  In Java protected means accessible within the
same package.
