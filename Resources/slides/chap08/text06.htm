<h1>The IS-a Rule</h1>
<p>
When is the use of inheritance appropriate?
There is a rule-of-thumb that is commonly used to answer this
question.  this is called the is-a rule.
<p>
The idea is that if you are trying to determine if a concept A should
be formed using inheritance from an existing concept B, try
forming the sentence ``an A is-a B''.  The result sounds right to your
ear, then in most cases A is an appropriate subclass of B.
<p>
For example, saying that a dog is-a mammal sounds right, therefore it
would be approrpaite to make the class Dog inherit from class Mammal.
<p>
On the other hand, saying that a car is-a engine sounds wrong, and
therefore inheritance would probably not be appropriate.  But a
car has-an engine, so there is some connection between the two
concepts, just not inheritance.
