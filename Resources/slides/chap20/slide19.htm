<h1>The Future of OOP</h1>
<font size=+2>
<P>
Given that the STL is not OO, does this mean that OOP is dead?
<P>
No, only that inspiration can come from a number of sources, and not
all problems are best solved in an OOP fashion.
<P>
However, many problems ARE best approached in an OOP manner.
<P>
Bottom line - know as much as you can about as many styles of programming
as you can, and use the style most appropriate to the problem.
