<h1> Step - Integration and Testing</h1>
<p>
Once components have been developed and tested in isolation, they
can then be integrated into larger units, and finally into
the completed system.  All during this process testing
can be performed to increase confidence in the final system.
<p>
The earlier an error can be discovered, the 
easier it will be to fix, and the less impact it will
have on the final system.
