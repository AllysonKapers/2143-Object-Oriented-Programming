<h1> User Manual</h1>

During initial design, the mindset of the design team is closer to
that of the eventual users then it will ever again be once the
system becomes operational.  Thus it is not irrational to at least
sketch out the user manual for the final system at this point, even
before the first line of code has been written.  
<p>
The user manual does not depend in a detailed way upon the implementation
details, so it can be developed (at least in large part) before the
implementation.
<p>
The narrative of the user manual can be made to flow naturally from
the process of walking through scenarious.
<p>
Finally, the user manual may
be an excellent vehicle to present to the client to ensure the
vision of the development team matches that of the client.
