<h1>Quality</h1>
<font size=+2>
<P>
You should always remember that the primary measure of quality is the
degree to which your customers (clients) are satisfied with your product.
<P>
Since often customers do not know exactly what it is they want, it is 
important to work with the client early in the design phase to make sure
the system your are developing is the desired product.  One very important
way to do this is to create the user manual even before the software is
written.
