<h1> Instances and Classes </h1>
<p>
Another dichotomy we see in the notion of a component is the distinction
between classes and instances.  Let us take, for example, the idea of a
receipe.  There are likely
many <EM>instances</EM> of recipe, but they will all <EM>behave</EM>
in the same way.  We say the behavior is common to the class <b>Recipe</b>.
<p>
Since during the design phase our goal is to concentrate on behavior, we
can large ignore this distinction and think in terms of prototypical
objects, ignorning their individual data values.
