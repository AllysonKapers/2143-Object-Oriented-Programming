<h1>Maintainence and Evolution</h1>
<font size=+2>
<P>
Software does not remain fixed after the first working version is released.
<P><UL>
<LI>
Errors or bugs can be discovered.  Must be corrected.
<LI>
Requirements may change.  Say as a result of government regulations, 
or standardization among similar products.
<LI>
Hardware may change.
<LI>
Users expectations may change.  Greater functionality, more features.
Often as a result of competition from similar products.
<LI>
Better documentation may be required.
</UL>
<P>
A good design recognizes the inevitability of change, and plans an
accommodation for these activities from the very beginning.
