<h1> Preparing for Change </h1>
<p>
As the application is being developed, the
design team should also keep in mind that change is inevitable.
Users requirements will often change with experience, 
hardware changes, government regulations change.
<UL>
<LI>
Try to predict the most likely sources of change, and isolate the effect.
Common changes include interfaces, file formats, communication protocols.
<LI>
Isolate interfaces to hardware that is likely to change.
<LI>
Reduce dependency of one software component on another.
This prevents changes in one component from rippling into changes
in other components.
<LI>
Keep accurate record of the reasoning behind every major decision in the 
design documentation.
