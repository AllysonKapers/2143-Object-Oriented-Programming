<h1> Two views of a Software System</h1>
This separation of interface and implementation leads naturally
to two views of a software system.  There is the external view,
that describes the behavior the system will exhibit, and the internal
view, that describes how that behavior is implemented.
The external user of a system needs only the external view,
while the implementator must have the very different internal view.
<p>
As we noted in Chapter one, the term information hiding is used
to describe the purposeful hiding of implementation details from
the outside world.
