<h1>Objects must be initialized</h1>
<p>
As we noted in the last slide, the language Object Pascal does not
have constructors, and so we must write explicit initialization
routines.  This slide shows one example.  A wall is initialized
by giving its coordinates, and a conversion factor used in
reflecting balls when they strike.
<p>
To set the region, we use a function, <b>SetRect</b>, provided by 
the Apple standard library.  This function takes four corrdinate
values and initializes a rectangle value.
