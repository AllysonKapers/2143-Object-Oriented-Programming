<h1>Purpose of Chapter</h1>
<p>
Once again, the purpose of this chapter is not to illustrate the solution
to a problem per se, but rather to illustrate a design that emphasizes
how you can structure a computer program as a universe of 
interacting agents that work together to produce the desired outcome.
