<h1>Properties</h1>
<p>
Properties are found in Delphi Pascal, Visual basic, C#, and a few other
languages.  The idea of a property is that it is a way to define
a getter or a setter, but allow them to use the same syntax
as if you had direct access to a data field.  Here we are imagining
that rank is a property, and notice that we use it as if it was simply
a data field.
