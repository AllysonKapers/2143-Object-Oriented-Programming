<h1>Class Definition in Apple Object Pascal</h1>
<p>
Here is a short definition in Apple Object Pascal.
Note that the keyword class is not used, but instead the keyword
object indicates that an object type is being defined.  We here show
only data fields.  Note that there are no explicit visibility modifiers
in Apple Pascal, and all attributes are implicitly public.  We will later
see the syntax used to define methods.
