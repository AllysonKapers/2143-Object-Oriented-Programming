<h1>Roadmap</h1>
<p>
Chapter 4 begins the first of a two chapter series.
We need to explore the syntax used to create classes and objects, and
to manipulate such values once they have been created.  But this is
a large topic.  We we break it into two smaller units.
Chapter 4 discusses the static, compile time representation of
object-oriented programs.  chiefly this means the syntax used
to create new classes.  Chapter 5 discusses the dynamic, run-time
behavior of programs.  This includes message passing, 
and object initialization.
Both of these topics are important, and both chapters should be understood
before you begin further investigation of object-oriented programming.
