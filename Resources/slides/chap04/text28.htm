<h1>Interfaces in Java</h1>
<p>
An interface is an idea found in Java, and in a few other languages.
An interface is similar to a class, but it defines no bodies for the
methods being defined.  Later, a class can declare it supports a given
interface, and at that point it must provide a method definition.
<p>
We will have much more to say about interfaces later, when we discuss
inheritance in detail.
