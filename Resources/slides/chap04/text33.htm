<h1>Chapter Summary</h1>
<p>
So we get to the end of this chapter.
To refresh your memory, in this chapter we have explored the syntax
used for class and method definition.  We have encountered the
visibility modifiers public and private, and noted their meaning.
We have described accessor or getter methods, as well as mutator
or setter methods, and some of the reasons for using these.  Finally,
we have examined some of the variations on the them of classes.
<p>
In the next chapter we will investigate the dynamic, or run-time,
behavior of object-oriented systems.
