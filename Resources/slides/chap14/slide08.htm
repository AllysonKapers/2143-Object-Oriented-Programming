<LI>
Composition is simpler, and clearly indicates what operations
are provided.
<p>
<li>
Inheritance makes for shorter code, possibly increased functionality,
but makes it more difficult to understand what behavior is being
provided.
<p>
<li>
Inheritance may open to the door for unintended usage, by means
of unintended inheritance of behavior.
<p>
<li>
Easier to change underlying details using composition (i.e., change
the data representation).
<p>
<li>
Inheritance may permit polymorphism
<p>
<li>
Understandability is a toss-up, each has different complexity issues
(size versus inheritance tree depth)
<p>
<li>
Very small execution time advantage for inheritance
