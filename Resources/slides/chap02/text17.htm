<h1>Encapulation and Interchangeability</h1>
<p>
An important aspect of the division into parts is to clearly 
characterizes the connection, or interface, between the different
components.   By doing this, it allows for the consideration of
multiple different implementations of the same interface.
For example, a car can have different different types of engine
and a single transmission.  This is possible because the different
engines, while have different performance characteristics, satisfy
the same interface as far as the transmission is concerned.
<p>
In software, we follow the same principle.  We try to characterize
a component by an interface that is independent of the implementation.
This allows us to easily slip different implementations in with 
minimal impact on the other parts of a system.
