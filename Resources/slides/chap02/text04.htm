<h1>Abstraction in an Atlas</h1>
<p>
As an illustration of abstraction, think of the maps that you might find
in a geographical atlas.  There are various different types of maps.
At each level, certain information is included, and certain information is
omitted.  A map of the world might only contain the names of vary large
features, such as mountain ranges, or large political boundaries.
A map of a contenent can contain more information, such as all political
boundaries, and maybe the names of large cities.
Moving to a smaller area, a map of a country would contain more cities,
and maybe start to contain information on major roads or highways.
A map of a large city might contain information on all roads, and
perhaps major structures of importance.  A map of just a portion of
a city will often contain the most information of all, indicating
individual buildings and perhaps their occupants.
<p>
At each level the developers have selected an approprate degree of
abstraction, including certain information and omitting other information.
