<h1>A Short History of Abstraction Mechanisms</h1>
<p>
I said at the beginning of the first chapter that OOP was both revolutionary
and evolutionary.  In the first chapter we explored some of the revolutionary
aspects.  In this section let us explore the evoluationary part.
We will do this by examining a short history of the development
of abstraction mechanisms for programming languages, and see how 
object-oriented fits into the picture.  Seen in this light, object-oriented
programming is a natural outgrowth of the ideas that preceded it.
