<h1>Levels of Abstraction in OO Programs</h1>
<p>
In a similar fashion, object-oriented programs can be examined at various
different levels of abstraction.  In fact, there are more levels in an
OO program than in a program created in a conventional fashion.  These
increased levels of abstraction are part of what characterizes OO programs.
<p>
For example, at the highest level of abstraction, we view an object-oriented
program as a community of interacting objects.  Each member of the
community is providing a service that is being used by other members
of the community.  At this level of abstraction, the important features
are the lines of communication between the various agents, the
structure of their interactions.
