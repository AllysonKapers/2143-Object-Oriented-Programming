<h1>Observations</h1>
<p>
To begin with, here are a few observations we can make regarding
the queens and their problem.
<p>
Since no column nor row can have more than one queen, we can assign
each queen to a specific column, and thereby reduce the problem to
finding a row assignment for each.
<p>
When we think about what the behavior of a queen should be,
one obvious behavior is that a queen should be able to take a pair
of arguments, and tell whether or not it can attack the given position.
<p>
One way (by no means the only way) is to structure the problem
using the concept of a <b>generator</b>.  Each queen can be asked
to find one solution, and then later be asked to find
another solution, if the first solution is unacceptable for the
problem as a whole.
