<h1>Test or Advance</h1>
<p>
Here is the pseudo-code description of test or advance.
If our neighbor can attack us, then we advance (by calling
our own next routine).  Otherwise, we found a solution
and return true.
<p>
Having written test or advance, we can simplify our earlier
version of the function first.  To find a first solution
we ask our neighbor for their first solution.  We then simply
place ourself in row 1, and test.
