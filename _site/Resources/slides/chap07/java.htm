<h1>Ball Games in Java</h1>
A slightly different series of Ball games are discussed in Chapters 5, 6
and 7 of my book <b>Understanding Object-Oriented Programming with Java</b>,
published by Addison-Wesley Longman in 1998.  The first of these discusses
a simple application that bounces a ball around the window.
Chapter 6 then dicusses a cannon firing game.  Chapter 7 discusses
a pinball construction kit.  The first of these, chapter 5, is
here available in either <a href="java.ps">postscript</a> or 
<a href="java.pdf">pdf</a> format.
