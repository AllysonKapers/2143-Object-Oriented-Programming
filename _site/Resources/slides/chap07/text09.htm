<h1>Using Inheritance</h1>
<p>
Although we won't talk about inheritance until chapter 7, we do note
that this program could have been simplified by using inheritance.
If we had inherited Balls, Walls and Holes from a common parent
class, say Graphical Object, then we could easily have reduced the
three loops in an earlier slide into a single loop.  This would have
made the program both shorter and more robust.
<p>
We will have much more to say about inheritance, and the power
it provides, in subsequent chapters.
