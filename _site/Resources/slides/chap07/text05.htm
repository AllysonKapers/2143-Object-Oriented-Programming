<h1>Graphical Objects can Draw themselves</h1>
<p>
Every object knows how to draw itself.  Again, this task is made
easy by using various routines provided by the Apple graphics
library.  A wall is a black rectangle.  A hole is a painted oval.
A ball is either a frame, if its the cue ball, or a painted circle.
