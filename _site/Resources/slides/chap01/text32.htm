<h1>From Newsweek</h1>
<p>
A few years ago I ran across the following quote in the magizine Newsweek
that illustrates some of the great power in finding the right metaphor.
``Unlike the usual programming method -- writing software one
line at a time, NeXT's object-oriented system offers larger building blocks
that developers can quickly assemble the way a kid builds faces on Mr.
Potato Head.''
<p>
The metaphor is effective, since it immediately conjures up images of
assemblying components to create a new entity, and the large number of
ways in which a few simple components can be assembled to construct a
wide variety of different results.  Thus, our experience from real life
can help us understand this new idea.
