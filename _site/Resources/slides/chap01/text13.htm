<h1>Recursive Design</h1>
<p>
Alan Kay has said that when he was designing Smalltalk he thought about
the idea of recursive design.  The idea of recursive design is that the
structure of the part mirrors the structure of the larger unit, rather
the way that fractals work or baroccoli grows.  That is, rather than
think of a computer as being composed of parts that each have less power
than the original, what if we think of a computer as being made up
of lots of little processing engines.
<p>
Each of these processing parts, called objects, can be thought of as
a computer-in-the-small.  They will have similar computational power
as the computer as a whole, and the processing will proceed by these
things acting together.
