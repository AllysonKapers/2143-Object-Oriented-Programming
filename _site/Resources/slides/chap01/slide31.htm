<h1>Metaphor and Problem Solving</h1>
<font size=+2>
<p>
Because the OOP view is similar to the way in which people go about
solving problems in real life (finding another agent to do the real
work!), intuition, ideas, and understanding from everyday experience
can be brought to bear on computing.
<p>
On the other hand, common sense was seldom useful when computers
were viewed in the process-state model, since few people solve their
everyday problems using pigeon-holes.
