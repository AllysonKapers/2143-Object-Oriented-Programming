<h1>An Example from Computer Languages</h1>
<p>
Here is an example drawn from my own personal experience.
Many years ago when I was a graduate student there was a fellow student
who was pursuing a project in DNA research.  His particular problem had
a very trivial statement.  A strand of DNA can be thought of as simply
a very long sequence of four elements, which could be represented by the
letters A, C, T and G.  His task was to see if any sequence of M values
was repeated.  Here N, the number of elements in the DNA sequence, is
hugely long but M, the size of the repeated sequence, was very small.
<p>
At the time FORTRAN was, and still is, considered the most ``efficient''
computer language.  To find the repeated sequence the student therefore
wrote a very short and direct FORTRAN program.  If you don't read
FORTRAN don't worry, this program is simply the obvious triply nested
loop, where the two outer loops control the starting point for a
comparison search, and the third inner loops compares the next M elements.
If the inner loop completes without finding any differences, then
a matching sequence has been found.
<p>
The student tried the program on some small data sets and measured the
time.  Extrapolating these measurements, the student then discovered that
to run on the real data set would take several days.  At this time the
mean time between failure of computers was measured in hours, so the
depressed student determined that the likelihood of being able to run
the program to completion was very small.
