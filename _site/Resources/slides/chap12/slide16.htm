<h1>An Old Joke Concerning Equality</h1>
<font size=+2>
There is an old joke that goes something like this: A man walks into
a pizza parlor and sits down.  A waiter comes to the table and asks the
man what he would like to order.  The man looks around the room, then
points to the woman sitting at the next table, and says ``I'll have what
she is eating.''  The waiter thereupon walks to the womans table,
picks up the half-eaten pizza from in front of her, and 
places it before the startled customer.
<p>
A classic confusion between <b>equality</b> and <b>identity</b>.
