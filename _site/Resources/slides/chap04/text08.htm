<h1>Visibility Modifiers</h1>
<p>
The terms public and private are used to differentate the internal
or implementation aspects of a class from the extenal, or interface
features.
Public features can be seen and manipulated by anybody in the object
community.  Private features, on the other hand, can be manipulated only
within a class.  Typically methods are public and data fields are
private, but this is only convention, and either type of feature
can be placed in either category.
