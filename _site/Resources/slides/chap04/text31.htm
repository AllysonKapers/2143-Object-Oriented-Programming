<h1>Inner or Nested Classes</h1>
<p>
Some languages, such as C++ or Java, allow a class definition to be
nested inside another class definition.  This feature can be very useful
in controlling the encapsulation of implementation details.
Whether the inner class can access features defines in the outer
class is different in different langauges; for example they can in Java,
but they cannot in C++.  This makes the utilization of this feature
very different in the two languages.  We will see examples of this
in later chapters.
