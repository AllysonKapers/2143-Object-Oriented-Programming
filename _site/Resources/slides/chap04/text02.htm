<h1>Same Ideas, Different Terms</h1>
<p>
There is a cronic problem in object-oriented programming; often, it seems,
in all of computer science.  This is that we use different terms for the
same concept, and the same terms to mean different concepts.
Thus, the idea of a class is, in Apples Object Pascal called an object type,
and in Objective-C termed a factory object.  We have already been using
the terms instances and objects interchangably.
Message passing is sometimes termed method lookup, or in C++ termed
member function invocation, or sometimes even method binding.
What in most languages are termed methods are, in C++, called member functions,
or sometimes method functions.  And what we will term inheritance is
sometimes called subclassing (we will occasionally use that term ourselves),
and sometimes called extension.
<p>
The book uses a simple and consistent vocabulary, independently of the
language being discussed.  Where there is doubt concerning the meaning
of a term you can consult the glossary at the back of the book.
