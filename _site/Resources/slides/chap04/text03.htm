<h1>Encapsulation and Instantiation</h1>
<p>
Classes are the bedrock on which all other object-oriented features are
constructed.  Classes provide a number of very important capabilities.
First and formost is encapsulation.  Like the earlier concept of the
module, a class provides a wrapping behind which can be hidden
an implementation.  By controlling what features can be seen outside
the class and what features are purely internal, they reduce the
amount of information that needs to be remembered or communnicated among
the various programmers working on a project.  As with an abstract data
type, this encapsulation allows one to characterize an object by the
service it provides, independently of the way that service is being
realized.  And finally, classes are the mechanism for instantiation,
the ability to stamp out multiple of instances of the same abstraction.
