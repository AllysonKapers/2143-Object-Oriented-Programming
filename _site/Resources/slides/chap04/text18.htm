<h1>Constructor</h1>
<p>
In C++, C#, Java and a few other languages a method that has the same
name as the class in which it is defined has a special meaning.
This is termed a constructor, and is used to initialize a newly
created object.  Notice also that the constructor does not specify
a return type.  We will have much more to say about constructors
in chapter 5.
