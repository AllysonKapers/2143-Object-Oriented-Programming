<h1>Why Use an Accessor</h1>
<p>
There are several reasons to prefer the use of an accessor method over
allowing direct access to a data field.  Most important, by using
an accessor one can make the data field read only.  The accessor allows
other objects to read the value of the data field, but not change it.
An accessor provides better documentation that the data field is
accessible.  And finally using an accessor makes it easier to accomodate
later changes to the access behavior.  For example, one might want to
count the number of accesses to a data value, or  the set some other value
when a data field is accessed, or whatever.  This can be easily accomodated
when an accessor is used, but is difficult otherwise.
<p>
Some languages suggest or encourage a special convention for accessors.
A common convention is to use the name get as a prefix, as in getRank.
However, this convention is not universally followed.
