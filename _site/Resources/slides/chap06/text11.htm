<h1>Can Attack</h1>
<p>
The can attack function looks complicated, but is really quite
simple.  It is easy to test whether or not we are in the same
row as the argument coordinate.
<p>
To test for diagonals, we observe that two queens are on
a diagonal from each other if the differences in their rows
is equal to the differences in their columns.  Since the
diagonal can either be moving upward or downward there are
two different cases to test.
<p>
If we cannot attack, it does not mean that the queen that
sent the argument values is safe.  The last thing we do is
to pass the message on to our neighbor.  Only if all queens
report that a position cannot be attacked can a queen feel
really safe.
