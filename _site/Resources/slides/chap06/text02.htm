<h1>OOP Approach</h1>
<p>
Now our interest here is not merely to solve the problem, since
this well-known problem has many solutions widely accessible.
Rather, our interest is to describe how one could go about solving
this problem in an object-oriented manner, and what it is that
makes the resulting solution object-oriented.
<p>
The idea is to create a community, and make the outcome of the
program be the result of the individuals in the community working
together.  Thus, we will create a coterie of queens, set them in
motion and let them find a solution amongst themselves.
<p>
This idea is similar to creating an artificial universe, and setting
it in motion.
<p>
Unlike a conventional program, there is no single controlling manager,
instead, control is decenteralized between the objects.
