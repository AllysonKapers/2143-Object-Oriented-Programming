<h1>Finding First Solution</h1>
<p>
Here is the process of finding our first solution, written in a
Pascal-like pseudo-code.
<p>
To find a first solution, we ask our neighhbor to find a first
solution.  If our neighbor cannot find a solution, then there is
no hope of our finding a solution, so we can return false.
<p>
Otherwise, we try each row in turn, and ask our neighbor if
they can attack.  If any row works, then we have a solution.
Otherwise, if no row works, we ask our neighbor to find 
another solution, and we try again.   When our neighbor reports
that no further solutions are possible, we report failure as well.
