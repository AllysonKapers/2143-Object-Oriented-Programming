<h1>Distributing Java Files by CD</h1>
<p>
In order to achieve platform independence, file names on this CD
are restricted to eight characters, and file extensions to three.
This makes it difficult to distribute .java and .class files.
The Java source can still be read as the file 
<a href="QSolve.jav">QSolve.jav</a>, unfortunately it cannot be
executed from the CD.  However, if you have a network connection,
the program can still be executed from the web page,
at
