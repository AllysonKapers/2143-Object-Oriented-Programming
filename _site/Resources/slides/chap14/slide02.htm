<h1>Definition of Polymorphic</h1>
<font size=+2>
<b>Polymorphous</b>: Having, or assuming, various forms, characters, or styles.
<p>
From greek routes, poly = many, and Morphos = form (Morphus was the greek 
god of sleep, who could assume many forms, and from which we derive the
name Morphine, among other things).
<p>
A polymorphic compound can crystalize in many forms, such as carbon, which can 
be graphite, diamonds, or fullerenes.
<p>
In programming languages, used for a variety of different mechanisms.
</font>
<p>
Usage of the term is confused by the fact that it means something
slightly different in the functional programming community than it
does in the OO world.)
