<h1>Procedures and Functions</h1>
<p>
The next step along the path of abstraction was the development of
procedures and functions.  Libraries of procedures, such as
mathematical libraries, or input/output libraries, provided the
first hints of information hiding.  These libraries raised the
level of abstraction, they permitted the programmer to think about
operations in high level terms, concentrating on the task to be done,
the what, and not on the implementation, the how.
<p>
while these were an important step, they were not an entirely effective
mechanism of information hiding, as we will explain in the next slide.
