<h1>Abstract Data Types</h1>
<p>
The 1970's saw the development of the idea of an abstract data type.
An ADT is a programmer defined data type that can be manipulated
in a fashion similar to system-provided data types.
This means that it must be possible to create, or instantiate, many
different copies of the data type.  The user can manipulate the
data type used only a limited set of provided operations, without
knowledge of the internal representation.
<p>
The most important aspect of the ADT concept was not that it was
applied to data structures, but that the operations of the data structure
were characterized by the service they provided, and not by their
implementation.  This was an important step in the direction of
object-oriented programming.
