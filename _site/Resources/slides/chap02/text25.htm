<h1>Modules</h1>
<p>
The next development in programming languages was the introduction of
an idea termed the module.  (Called the unit in Pascal, name space in C++,
various other names in different languages).
Stripped to its most primitive form, the module simply provided the
ability to encapsulate a collection of procedures and data values,
and export only a limited number of those procedures or data areas.
<p>
So the writer of our stack abstraction would now hide the implementation
data values, and only export the names push, pop and top.
<p>
Modules nicely solved the problem of encapsulation.  But now there was
another problem.  What if your programming task required two or more
stacks?  The module facility by itself did not provide the ability
to create multiple instances of a data type.  So solving this
required the next development in programming langauges.
