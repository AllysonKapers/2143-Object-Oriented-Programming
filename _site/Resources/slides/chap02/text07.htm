<h1>Clients and Servers</h1>
<p>
Moving one step further, the next level of abstraction considers the
relationship between two interacting objects.
Typically one of the objects if providing a service, and the other
is making use of the service.  The important feature to note here is
the structure of the interaction between the two agents.
<p>
By the way, we use the term client and server here in a very loose
and informal way, not necessarily as the terms are used in, for example,
the networking sense.  Although network clients and servers can be viewed
as a special case of this relationship.
