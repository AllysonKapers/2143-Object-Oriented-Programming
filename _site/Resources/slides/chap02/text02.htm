<h1>Abstraction</h1>
<p>
What is abstraction?
As manifest in computer science, abstraction is th epurposeful suppression,
or hiding, of some details of a process or artifact, in order to bring
out more clearly other aspects, details, or structure.  In abstraction
we try to uncover the inherient characteristics of an item, ignoring
unnecessary details.
<p>
For example, I might abstract my view of an automobile by saying it is
a device that connects fuel to an engine, a transmission, and the wheels.
At the high level this has some relationship to reality, and it allows
me to break the system down into component parts, examining those
parts in isolation from each other.
