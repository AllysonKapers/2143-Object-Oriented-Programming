<h1>Information Hiding -- the Problem of Stacks</h1>
<p>
Here is an example problem that we will use as illustration in the
next several slides.  Imagine a programming teach containing several
indivduals.  One programmer is charged with the development of
a stack data abstraction.   The stack can be characterized by 
several routines, push, pop, top, and so on.  So the programmer
dutifully sits down and develops a program, such as the one shown here.
<p>
Now imagine that the second programmer wants to use the stack.   The
second programmer must know of the names for the routines: push, pop,
top.  But what about the underlying data values; those values used
in the implementation of the stack.  here these are the array named
datastack and the integer value named datatop.  These values cannot
be local to any single routine, since they must be shared between
the different functions.  In a language in which procedures are our
only abstraction mechanism, the only other choice is to make them
global.  But this means that the second programmer, the programmer
who only wanted to use the stack, must be made aware of the names
for these values; if for no other reason then they are not allowed
to define other variables with the same name.
<p>
Multiply this problem several hundredfold and you see the difficulty
of using procedures as an abstraction mechanism.
