<h1>An Implementation</h1>
<p>
But behind an offer to provide a service must be an implementation that
satisfies the contract defined by the interface.  So this level of
abstraction is again looking at the server side, but this time from 
the ``inside'', and not the ``outside''.  The concern here is with the
high level approach that is being used to provide the designated
service.
<p>
For example, a stack data type can be implemented using a linked list,
an array, or a number of other techniques.
