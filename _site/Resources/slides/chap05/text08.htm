<h1>Memory Recovery</h1>
<p>
Because the <b>new</b> operator is activated at run-time, it means that
memory is allocated during the course of execution.  We call this process
dynamic memory allocation.  On the flip side, it means there must
be a process or recovering the memory associated with no longer useful 
objects, since otherwise long running programs could quickly run out of
memory.  There are two broad approces to this task.  In some languages
the programmer must explicitly say when a value is no longer being used.
In C++, for example, the programmer uses the statement <b>deleted</b>,
while in Object Pascal the statement is named <b>free</b>.
<p>
The other approach is to use what is known as a <b>garbage collection</b>
system.  A garbage collection system monitors memory use, and will
automatically determine when a value is no longer being used,
and hence can be recovered.
