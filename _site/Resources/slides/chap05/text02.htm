<h1>Messages are not Function Calls</h1>
<p>
Back in chapter 1 we discussed the way in which a message is different
from a procedure or function call.  In particular, a message is always
given to some object, which we call the receiver.  
More importantly, the message and the body of code that will
eventually be executed are only loosely related.  The action that
will be performed in response to the message is determined, at run
time, by the reciever.  Different receivers can be given the same
message, and will perform different actions.
A function, on the
other hand, is simply a body of code, it does not have a receiver,
and the function will always execute the same actions.
