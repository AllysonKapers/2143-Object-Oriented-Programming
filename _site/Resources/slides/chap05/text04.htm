<h1>Statically Typed and Dynamically Typed Languages</h1>
<p>
Here is a distinction we will see throughout the term.  Languages
can be divided into two large categories, those that are statically
typed and those that are dynamically typed.  A statically typed
language requires a type declaration for every variable, and types
are known at compile time.  A dynamically typed language, on the other
hand, types variables at run time based on their current value.
<p>
The distinction is important at this point because the two different
forms of language treat message passing slightly different.
Statically typed languages check the validity of message passing
expressions at compile time, based on the types associated with
the declarations of variables.  Dynamically typed languages
type variables at run time, and produce far fewer compile time
error messages.
