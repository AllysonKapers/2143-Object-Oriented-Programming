<h1>Constructors</h1>
<p>
We turn now to another issue involved in the creation of new objects.
In many languages the programmer is allowed to define a special
type of function, termed a <b>constructor</b>.  A constructor function
is implicitly invoked when a new object is created.  The body of the
constructor can perform whatever actions are necessary in order to
make sure that an object is properly initialized.
<p>
In C++, Java and C# a constructor is a function with the same name
as the class in which it is declared.  In Python it is named __init__.
In Delphi and Objective-C constructor do not have a special name, but
have a different syntax.  (In Delphi it is a conveciton
to name your constructors <b>create</b>, but this is not a language
requirement.)
<p>
The example code shows a constructor written in Java.
