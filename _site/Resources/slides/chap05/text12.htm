<h1>Metaclasses</h1>
<p>
The object/class model sometimes makes for subtle oddities.
For example, in Smalltalk <b>new</b> is just a message, like any other
message.  The reciever for the message is a class, an instance of <b>Class</b>.
<p>
So, let us know ask where a constructor; that is, a class specific 
initialization, could fit into this picture.  Such a method cannot be part
of the collection of messages understood by instances of the class,
since we do yet have an instance.
<p>
But such a message cannot be understood by class <b>Class</b>, since
not all classes have the same constructor semantics.  So, where should
we put this behavior for individual class instances?
