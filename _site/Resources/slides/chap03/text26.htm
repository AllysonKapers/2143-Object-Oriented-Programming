<h1> Interface and Implementation</h1>
<p>The emphasis on behavior naturally results in a characterization of
a component that describes what it does, not how it goes about
achieving the expected result.
<p>
We say that components are described by their interface, not their
implementation.  The user of such a component needs only know what
the compoment does, not how it does it.
