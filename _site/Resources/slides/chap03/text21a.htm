<h1>Interaction Diagrams</h1>
<p>
The picture on the previous slide captures the static relationships
between the various components, but does nothing to indicate the
dynamic flow of messages during the processing of a senario.
To capture this information a different type of diagram can be used.
<p>
This chart is called an interaction diagram.  Is is read from top
to bottom.  Each component is marked by a vertical line.  Communication
between components is marked by horizontal directed arrows between the 
vertical lines.  A comment on the far right then indicates the
nature of the connection.
