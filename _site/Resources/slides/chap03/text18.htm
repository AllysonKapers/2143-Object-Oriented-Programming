<h1> The Planner Component</h1>
<p>
We complete the browsing scenario, and then go back to the beginning.
Starting once more with the greeter, we begin a different scenario.
This time, we assume the user elects to plan a series of meals.
This leads to the description of the <b>Planner</b>.
<p>
The planner permits the user to select a sequence of dates for the
purposes of planning.  Having selected some dates, the unit permits
the user to edit an existing plan, or create a new one.  We will
separate out a Plan, which is a sequence of dates, from an individual
<b>Date</b>, which is a series of meals within one 24-hour period.
This is not the only potential design, but is one possibility out
of many other alternatives.
