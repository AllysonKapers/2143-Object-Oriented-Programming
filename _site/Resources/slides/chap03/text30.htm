<h1> Next Step - Formalize the Interface</h1>
<p>
Following the initial design, the next step is to formalize the
channels of communcation between the components.
<UL>
<LI>
The general structure of each component is identified.
<LI>
Components with only one behavior may be made into functions.
<LI>
Components with many behaviors are probably more easily implemented as classes.
<LI>
Names are given to each of the responsibilities - these will eventually be
mapped on to procedure names.
<LI>
Information is assigned to each component and accounted for.
</ul>
Scenarios are then replayed, using the formal behavior names, in 
order to ensure all data is available and all activity is performed.
