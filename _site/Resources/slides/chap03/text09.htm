<h1> Abilities of the IIKH </h1>
<p>
Now, he hasn't left you entirely in the dark.  Looking at the rumpled
dinner napkin, you notice that he has defined some of the tasks
he would like the IIKH to perform.  The system should allow the user
to:
<UL>
<LI>
Browse a database of Recipes
<LI>
Add a new recipe to the database
<LI>
Edit or annotate an existing recipe
<LI>
Plan a meal consisting of several courses
<LI>
Scale a recipe for some number of users
<LI>
Plan a longer period, say a week
<LI>
Generate a grocery list that includes all the items in all the menus for a
period
</UL>
So this is the starting place you must use for your design.
