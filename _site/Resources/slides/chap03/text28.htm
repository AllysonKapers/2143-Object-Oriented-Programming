<h1> Parnas' Principles</h1>
<p>
Again reiterating a point we made back in chapter one, we note that
this separation between interface and implementation was captured by
computer scientist David Parnas in a pair of rules, which are known
as Parnas's Principles:
<UL>
<LI>
The developer of a software component must provide the intended user with
all the information needed to make effective use of the services provided
by the component, and should provide <EM>no</EM> other information.
<LI>
The implementor of a software component must be provided with all the
information necessary to carry out the given responsibilities assigned to
the component, and should be provided with <EM>no</EM> other information.
</ul>
<p>
Following Parnas's principles leads to components that have clean
separation from each other.
