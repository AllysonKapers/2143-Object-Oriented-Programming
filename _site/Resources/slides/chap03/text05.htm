<h1>Responsibility Driven Design</h1>
<p>
The technique I describe in this chapter is called <i>Responsibility-Driven
Design</i>, and is adapted from the work of Rebecca Wirfs-Brock,
who describes it in her book <i>Designing Object-Oriented Software</i>.
<p>
I like responsibility-driven design, because it seems to match the way
software is really created.  It can deal with ambiguous and incomplete
specifications, which is almost always the way specifications begin.
<p>
It flows natrually from an analysis of the problem, to the design of
the solution.
<p>
Finally, it easily integrates with various aspects of software development.
<p>
I'll illustrate RDD by means of an extended example problem.
