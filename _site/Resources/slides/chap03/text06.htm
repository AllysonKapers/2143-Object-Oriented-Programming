<h1> Directed Evolution</h1>
<p>
As I mentioned in a previous slide, earlier software development techniques
often began with the assumption that you had a complete formal specification.
But this assumption denies human nature.  Clients seldom have a complete
and through description of what they want, instead they have a vague
idea or a concept.  Thus, specifications as they occur in reality
are imprecise, ambiguous, and unclear.
<p>
Rather than attempting to change human nature -- that is, to make all
clients describe their ideas only in terms of a formal specification 
language, let us instead take specifications as they commonly occur,
and turn a necessity into a virtue by using the evolution of the
more complete understanding of the specification into a chance to
design the corresponding software system.
