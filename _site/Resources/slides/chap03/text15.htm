<h1> The Recipe Database Component </h1>
<p>
We continue with a senario.  Ignoring, for the moment, the possibility
of creating or planning meals, we continue with a use-case that has
the user electing to explore the database of recipies.  Having selected
this choice, control is then passing to the recipe database component,
which is separate and independent of the greeter.
<p>
The recipe database component is involved in all activities that involve
direct access to the database.  This means the recipe database must
provide a number of different services.  These include the following:
<UL>
<LI>
Must Maintain the Database of Recipes.
<LI>
Must Allow the user to <EM>browse</EM> the database.
<LI>
Must permit the user to edit or annotate an existing recipe.
<LI>
Must permit the user to add a new recipe.
</UL>
