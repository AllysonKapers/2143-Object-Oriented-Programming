<h1>Abstract Idea of Inheritance</h1>
<p>
Recall we introduced the concept of inheritance back in chapter 1.
There, we motived the idea with a description from real life.
Inheritance in that chapter was described as a process of categorization.
We categorized objects into different levels, using abstraction to 
factor out common features.  Categories lower in the hierarchy
held all the properties known concerning categories higher in
the hierarachy.  For example, everything you know about an Animal
is applicable to a Mammal, and so on.
