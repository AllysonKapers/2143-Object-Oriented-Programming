- Each question is graded based on the following criteria (loosely based).
- Ultimately I look at a question and decide if it's `A`,`B`, `C`, `D` or `F` work using my criteria. If I decide it's A work, I'll take 0 -1 points away, if it's B work, I'll take 2 / 10 points away and so on. 

#### For questions 2-5:
- Minimum class syntax correct: 10%
```cpp
class name{
private:
public:
};
```
- Appropriate data members and types chosen for class.  25%
- One or more constructors included and appropriately formatted. 25%
- No implementation unless asked. 15%
- Min Required Setters and Getters included in answer. 25%
