<h1>Programming in the Small and Programming in the Large</h1>
<p>
If you are a student, most of what you have probably been involved with
in relation to programming can be characterized as programming in the
small.  Programming in the small involves one programmer, who 
understands all aspect of a computer program from top to bottom.
The major difficulty in software development is algorithmic, finding
the correct sequence of operations to get the computer to do what
you want.  Programming in the small is like solving a puzzle, and
rewards those with good puzzle solving skills.
<p>
In contrast, programming in the large is an entirely different type
of task.  Large software applications are developed by a team of
programmers, perhaps a dozen, sometimes hundreds.  In this environment,
the major problems are not algorithmic.  Instead, the major problems
are communication issues.  How much information does programmer A
need to know about the work being performed by programmer B in order to
do his or her job?
<p>
To illustrate, consider the issue of information hiding, which in chapter One
I indentified as a fundamental tool in the control of complexity.
In a one programmer project, who are you hiding information from?
Yourself?  Or the computer?  The concept simply does not make any sense.
<p>
In a multi-person project, the concept makes abundant sense.  By
focusing on information hiding, you reduce the amount of information that
must be communicated between programmers.  This reduces the chances
for error, makes it easier for each member of a team to develop and test
his or her section in isolation, and has a host of other beneficial
effects.
