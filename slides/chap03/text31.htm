<h1> A Rose by any other Name </h1>
<p>
The task of selecting names is not as simple as it might at first
appear.  Indeed, this can often be one of the most important
aspects of the design process.
<p>
Shakespeare can <a href="shakespear.au">claim</a> that a change 
in name does not alter the object
being described, yet we know from government bureaucrats that
obscure and idiomatic names can make even the simplest operation sound
intimidating.  Thus, names should be selected with a great deal of
care and thought.
<UL>
<LI>
Names should be evocative in the context of the problem.
<LI>
Names should be short.
<LI>
Names should be pronounceable.  To test this, try reading them out loud.
<LI>
Names should be consistent within the project.
<LI>
Digits within a name should be avoided.
</ul>
