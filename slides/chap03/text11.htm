<h1> Working Through Scenarios </h1>
<p>
Like all beginning specifications, the specification provided by the
dinner napkin is ambiguous or mute on a number of important points.
Because we need to clarify these with the client, we need a tool
that will help us uncover the desired behavior.  A very useful
technique is to describe the application by means of a series
of scenarios, sometimes called use-cases.
<p>
You pretend that a working application already exists.  You walk through
the various uses of the system, describing in detail what is happening
at each moment.  You can perhaps even create dummy screen shots.
<p>
One purpose is to establish the ``look and feel'' of the system,
and make certain this agrees with the clients vision.
<p>
Another purpose is to make certain we have uncovered all the intended
uses.  As we brainstorm, some new applications for the system might
become apparent that were not forseen in the first analysis.
<p>
As part of ensuring the vision for the application matches that of
the client, we can create descriptive documentation.  This can be
the basis for later artificats, such as a user manual.  It is at
this stage of the process that the view held by the design team
most closely matches that of the eventual users, and the questions
raised by the design team will mirror the eventual questions that
will be asked by users.
<p>
Finally, and what is most useful, we can at this point lay the
foundations for the eventual software system, by creating a high
level software design.
