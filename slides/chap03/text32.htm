<h1> Documentation </h1>
<p>
Far too often, documentation is left as an after-thought, to be
performed once the application is developed and running.  This
can be a serious mistake.
<p>
We will have more to say regarding the user manual on the next slide.
<p>
Other design documentation should be maintained to record decisions
made and, often just as important, decisions considered and rejected,
and the reasons for the rejection.  This will often save the time
and effort of revisiting the same decision multiple times.
