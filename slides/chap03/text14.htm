<h1> The first component, The Greeter</h1>
<p>
The first component we can identifiy in the IIKH is the component that has
control when the application is first started.  Let us call this
component the <b>Greeter</b>, since its major task is to display a greeting.
<p>
When the application begins, the greeter puts an information and friendly
welcome window on the screen.  Through this window, the user is offered
the choice of several different actions.  These include browsing the
database of recipies, adding a new recipe to the database, edit or
annotating a recipe, or reviewing or creating a plan for several meals.
<p>
Many of the details concerning exactly how this is to be accomplished can
be left out of the description for the moment.  For example, we need not
know whether these actions are provided by means of button, pull down
menus, touch screens, voice commands, or something entirely different.
All we need in order to proceed is the knowledge that by some means
the user can indicate one action out of a list of choices.
