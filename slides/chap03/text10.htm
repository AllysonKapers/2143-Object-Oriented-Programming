<h1> Characterization by Behavior </h1>
<p>
Back in Chapter one I mentioned the idea of an abstract data type.
You will recall that an abstract data type is characterized by behavior,
by the operations it performs, and not by its representation.
<p>
Responsibility-driven design extends this idea to the entire design
process.  What we have first is a description, even if it is only
an informal back-of-the-napkin description, of the behavior for the
entire application.  Our first task will be for expand on this,
and to capture the behavior of the whole application.
<p>
Next, we refine this into descriptions of subsystems for the application.
Again, these will be characterized simply by the operations they perform,
that is, their behavior.
<p>
Finally, we refine these behavioral descriptions into actual code.
While ultimately will be the final application.
<p>
This emphasis on behavior is a hallmark of object-oriented programming.
