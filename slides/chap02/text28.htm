<h1>Three Eons of History</h1>
<p>
In one sense, objects have simply taken this notion of the ADT and expanded
it beyound the application to simple data structures.  That is, objects
are characterized by the service they provide, not by the way they provide
this service.  Seen in this light, we can identify three eons in the short
history of programming languages.  Assembly languages and functions were
important when the task of programming was centered on the functionality
of an application.  The move to modules and ADTs was symptomatic of
a move to a more data centered view of programming, the identifcation of
data structures the defining aspects of a program.  In Objects we
now take a third step; instead of a function or data centered view of
programming, the major keystone of the Object-oriented mindset is
the service centered view of computing; elements of a program are
characterized by the services they provide, independent of the way
that they go about providing that service.
