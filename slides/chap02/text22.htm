<h1>Assembly Languages</h1>
<p>
In the first computers everything was numeric.  Memory addresses were
numeric, instruction opcodes were numeric, everything had to be translated
into number form.
<p>
One of the first steps along the path of abstraction was the development
of assembly languages.  These allowed the programmer to work in
a more symbolic fashion, rather than simply with numbers.  Addresses
could be represented symbolically, as could operation designators (or opcodes).
The linking of symbolic names to numeric addresses would then be performed
automatically by software, and not by the programmer.
<p>
A small step, but a first step.
