<h1>Packages and Name Spaces</h1>
<p>
Moving down slightly, we reach a level of abstraction that is found
in some, but not all object-oriented languages.  Many languages allow
the programmer to group a collection of objects and classes together,
exposing only a small number of these to the rest of the virtual
application community.  This ability is known by different names
in different languages.  In Java it is called a package, while in
C++ it is termed a name space, and in Delphi it is known as a unit.
All of these are heir to the idea developed in pre-OO days known
as the module.
<p>
The module is simply a way to encapsulate a small community in itself,
controlling the visibility from outside the module.
