<h1>Is-a and Has-a abstraction</h1>
<p>
Two of the most important types of abstraction deal with how we can take
a complex system and break it into simpler pieces that can then be
considered separately.  These two types of abstraction are a division
into parts, and division into specialization.  Colloquially, these
are known by the terms ``has-a'' and ``is-a'' abstraction.
For example, a car has an engine, but a car is a means of transportation.
