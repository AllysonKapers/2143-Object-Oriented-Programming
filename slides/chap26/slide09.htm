<h1>Across a Network</h1>
<font size=+2>
The next level of complexity is to do the same sort of thing, but
allow the components to exist across the network.
<p>
This is part of what MS is trying to do with its dot-net program.
Allow the creation of components which can then be assembled even
when they exist on widely separated computers.
<p>
Many parts of this problem:
<ul>
<li>Registration -- how do you find out what components exist out there?
<li>Interface Query -- how do you find out what interfaces these components
use
<li>Connection -- how do you make a dynamic connection with a remote object
<li>Interaction -- how do you communicate with a remote object
</ul>
<p>
Each of these steps is at the moment unstandarized, but a lot of
effort is going into each.  Expect a lot of work on this in the future.
