<h1>Properties in C#</h1>
<p>
Here we show how properties are defined in the language C#.
Within the body of a method we use the keywords get and set.
The get section must return a value, while the set routine can
use a pseudo-variable named <b>value</b> to set a value.
But the get and set sections are free to do whatever other
actions they desire.  Omitting the set part makes a property that
is read-only, while omitted a get makes it write-only.
Write only values are far less common than read-only values.
