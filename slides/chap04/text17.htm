<h1>An Example, from C#</h1>
<p>
Here, for example, is a class definition in C#, showing 
various method definitions.  Notice the methods in the middle.
Following the visibility keyword public is the method return type,
followed by the method name, followed by an argument list (in all but
one method this is empty), followed by the method body surrounded
by curly braces.  If the method is small enough to be put on one
line I've done so, notice the method named color is much
longer, and spans several lines.
