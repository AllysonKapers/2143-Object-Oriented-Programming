<h1>Class Data Fields</h1>
<p>
A common need is to have all instances of a class share a common data
field.  It's a simple idea in principle, but comes with a subtle paradox.
Classes are used to define common behavior.  That means every instance
of a class shares the same behavior with every other instance.  having
noted this, we can then ask who is responsible for initializing
the common data field.  Seemingly either everybody must do this, which
seems bad, or nobody will, which is also bad.
<p>
This paradox is resolved in different ways in the various different
object-oriented langauges.  See the book for details.
