<h1>Pascal Dialects</h1>
<font size=+2>
We will consider two dialects of Pascal, both descended from the
earlier language.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Apple Object Pascal: Defined by Apple Computer, once widely used
on the Macintosh, now much less commonly used.
<p>
<li>Delphi Pascal: Defined by Borland on the PC, still fairly widely used
on that plaform.  (Called Kylix on the Linux platform).
</ul>
<br>
Many similaries due to the common heritage, but some important 
differences.
<p>
</font>
(We consider only the language aspects of Delphi, there are many other
features related to its visual interface that we will not describe).
