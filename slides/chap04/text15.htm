<h1>Smalltalk</h1>
<p>
I can't show you the textual description of a class in Smalltalk, because
there isn't one.  Instead of writing a text file to define a program,
in Smalltalk use describe a class using a visual interface.
This was a revolutionary idea in 1980, when Smalltalk was released,
but now that Visual Basic and Delphi and other systems use similar ideas
the concept is not quite so revolutionary.
<p>
Using the Smalltalk browser, the user selects the parent class for
the new class being defined.  A message is then given to the parent
class, which constructs the new child class.
