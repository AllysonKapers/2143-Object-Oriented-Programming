<h1>Kay's Description of Object-Oriented Programming</h1>
<p>
Kay then refined this idea into six principles of object-oriented programming.
<p>
First, everything is an object.  Rather than thinking about a single memory
cell as being our fundamental unit of computation, let us imagine a little
computing engine as our basic unit.
<p>
Objects must interact to get anything accomplished.  So we will say that
objects proceed by making requests on each other.  We will call such a
request a message.
<p>
Like the computer-in-the-small that we imagine it is, an object has its
own memory, which (following the principle of recursive design) will consist
of other objects.
<p>
A universe that consists of a large number of objects turns out to be
rather unwieldy unless we impose some form of structure.  We can add structure
by saying that every object is an instance of a class.  A class is
similary just a grouping of similar objects.
<p>
In particular, we will say that the class is the repository for behavior
associated with an object.  By that we mean that all instances of the same
class will have the same behavior.
<p>
Finally, even more structure can be provided by organizing classes into
singly-rooted tree structures, which we will call an inheritance hierarchy.
<p>
We can illustrate these principles by considering how I go about solving
a problem in real life.
