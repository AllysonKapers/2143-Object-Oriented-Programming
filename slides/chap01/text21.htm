<h1>Different Actions</h1>
<p>
The fact that the same message may elicit different responses is illustrated
by the following example.  
As we have seen, the message <i>sendFlowers</i> can be given to Fred, my
florist, and will yield the desired result.  
<p>
However, Chris can send the same
message to <b>Elizabeth</b>, a mutual friend.  
She will accept the message, and the
desired outcome will be produced.  However, the actions performed by
Elizabeth will be different from the actions performed by Fred.  So we have
the same message, but two different behaviors.  The interpretation,
that is the actions performed, differ depending upon who the message
is given two.
<p>
As a third example, if I give the message to Ken the dentist, he will
reject the message and issue a run-time error message.  So, not all objects
will accept all messages.
