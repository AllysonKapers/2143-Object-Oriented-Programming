<h1>Non-interference</h1>
<p>
Tied to the notion of information hiding is an important principle of
non-interference.  I leave it to Flo to determine how to run her business.
As long as she provides the service I want, namely sending flowers to my
friend, I do not really care how she actually operates her business.
<p>
Once again, this concept of thinking in terms of objects and the services
they provide is an important key in structuring large complex software 
systems.  Components in such a system will be characterized by the service
they provide, and not by any internal implementation details.  This 
viewpoint permits several programmers to work on the same system with
minimal interference in each others work.  It also makes it much easier
to carry significant portions of a program from one application to the next.
<p>
It is curious that the object-oriented outlook tends to elicit 
a variety of anthropormorphic descriptions from people.  Dan Ingalls,
one of the developers of the original Smalltalk systems at Xerox Parc,
has described object-oriented programming this way:  ``Instead of a 
bit-grinding processor raping and plundering data structures, we have
a universe of well-behaved objects that courteously ask each other to
carry out their various desires''.
<p>
Another description echos a quote from a famous presidents inagural address:
``Ask not what you can do TO your data structures, but ask what your
data structures can do FOR you''
