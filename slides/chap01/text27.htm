<h1>Class Hierarchies</h1>
<p>
We can describe these levels of abstraction in a type of picture known
as a <i>class hierarchy</i>.  A class hierarchy picture is similar to the
genus-species categorization familiar from biology.   The idea is
that more abstract categories are presented at the top of the
hierarchy, and more specific categories below.
<p>
In this picture both living things and non-living things are forms of
material object.  Information that I have concerning material objects,
such as the fact they have mass and occupy some volume of space, is 
applicable to both things living and things not living.
Information I have about living things is applicable to both plants
and animals.  Information I know about human being is applicable to
both my dentist Ken and my friend Elizabeth, as well as the Florist Fred.
<p>
We will often use the term <i>parent class</i> and <i>child class</i>
to refer to a particular relationship in the class hierarchy.
Mammal is a child class of Animal, for example, and Material Object
is a parent class of Living Thing.  The phrase superclass and subclass
is also sometimes used to represent the same idea.  Extending the parent/child
metaphor, we will often say, for example, that Living Thing is an
ancestor class to Human Being.
