<h1>solution: A class for a class</h1>
<p>
The solution is to make a new class, a subclass of <b>Class</b>.
The only instance of this class is the new class being define.
Common class behavior is inherited from the parent, the constructor
is defined in the child.  This is an elegant solution that
maintains the simple object/class relationship.
