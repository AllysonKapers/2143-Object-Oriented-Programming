<h1>Memory Errors</h1>
<p>
The arguments for and against the use of garbage collection pit
efficiency against correctness.  A GC system necessarily imposes 
a penalty in execution time, on the other hand it can significantly
reduce programming errors.  Language designers fall on both sides
of this argument.
<p>
Among the errors that a garbage collection system can help avoid
are the following.  Most obviously running out of memory because
the programmer forgot to free values.  But another error is using
a memory value after it has been recovered (that is, after the
programmer has indicated it can be deleted).  A third type of error
is attempting to free the same value twice.
In systems that lack garbage collection systems any of these can
lead to difficult to detect errors.
