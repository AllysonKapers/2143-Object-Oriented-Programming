<h1>Picture of Billiards Table</h1>
<p>
The application we will describe is inspired by a pool table.
We have fifteen balls, a cue ball, walls, holes in the corners.
<p>
To be honest, this isn't billiards, this isn't pool, it's just
a bunch of balls bounding around a table so as to illustrate
a variety of object-oriented techniques.
