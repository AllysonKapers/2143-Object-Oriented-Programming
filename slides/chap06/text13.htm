<h1>Final Analysis</h1>
<p>
The importance of this problem is not that we were able to find a solution,
but rather the way the solution is structured.
<p>
The solution is the result of a community of objects, that interact
with each other and work cooperatively to find a solution.
<p>
There is no single controlling program, rather control is decenteralized
and each queen is given an important task to perform.
<p>
So, we have a universe of active objects that each determine their own
actions and behavior.
