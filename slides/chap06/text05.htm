<h1>CRC Card for Queen</h1>
<p>
Here is a CRC card description for the queen objects.
<p>
Each queen can be initialized.  When initialized, it finds a position so
that it cannot attack or be attacked by any of its neighbors to the left.
<p>
Should that initial position prove to be not part of the more global solution,
each queen can be asked to find another position, its next position,
which is also agreeable to itself and its neighbors on the left.
<p>
A queen can print its current position.  It will pass this message on to
its neighbor, so that all positions are printed.
<p>
Finally, a queen can take a pair of coordinates, and determine if it
or any of its neighbors can attack a given position.
